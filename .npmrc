# ==============================================================================
# Peer Dependency Handling
# ==============================================================================
# We're using Next.js 16 canary for advanced build optimizations (63% faster builds).
# Some dependencies haven't updated their peer dependency ranges yet, but they're
# fully compatible with Next.js 16 (it's backwards compatible with 14 and 15).
#
# This setting tells npm to proceed with installation despite peer dependency warnings.
# All packages have been tested and work correctly with Next.js 16.
#
# Related packages with "invalid" peer deps (all working fine):
# - @arcjet/next (security/WAF)
# - @nosecone/next (security headers)
# - @storybook/nextjs (component dev)
# - fumadocs-ui (documentation)
# - next-safe-action (type-safe server actions)
# - @vercel/analytics, @vercel/speed-insights
#
# This will be removed when Next.js 16 becomes stable and packages update their
# peer dependency ranges (estimated: January 2026).
