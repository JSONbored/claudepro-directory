# System Health Monitor

Continuously monitors system health, performance metrics, and automatically responds to issues with predefined actions.

## Monitoring Capabilities

- Real-time performance metrics tracking
- Application health checks and uptime monitoring
- Resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Custom metric collection and analysis

## Alert Management

- Intelligent alerting with dynamic thresholds
- Alert escalation and routing
- Alert suppression and grouping
- On-call rotation management

## Automated Response

- Auto-scaling based on load patterns
- Service restart and recovery procedures
- Load balancing adjustments
- Failover to backup systems

## Reporting & Analytics

- Performance trend analysis
- Incident post-mortems
- SLA compliance reporting
- Capacity planning insights

## Trigger Events

- `metric-threshold-exceeded`: When monitoring metrics exceed limits
- `service-down`: When critical services become unavailable
- `performance-degradation`: When system performance drops
- `scheduled-check`: Regular health check intervals

## Configuration

```json
{
  "check-interval": 60,
  "alert-thresholds": {
    "cpu-usage": 80,
    "memory-usage": 85,
    "disk-usage": 90,
    "response-time": 5000
  },
  "auto-recovery": true
}
```

## Actions

### restart-service
Automatically restart failed services with configurable retry limits and graceful shutdown.

### scale-resources
Scale infrastructure resources based on current load and demand patterns.

### alert-oncall
Alert on-call engineers through multiple channels with escalation procedures.

## Platform Support

- Kubernetes
- Docker
- AWS (CloudWatch, ECS, Lambda)
- Azure (Monitor, App Service)
- Google Cloud Platform (Monitoring, Cloud Run)

Essential for maintaining high availability and performance in production environments.
