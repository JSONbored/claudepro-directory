# API Rate Limit Guardian

Intelligent API rate limiting and traffic management with dynamic scaling and protection mechanisms.

## Rate Limiting Features

- Dynamic rate limiting based on user behavior
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- Burst capacity management
- Geographic rate limiting
- API endpoint-specific limits

## Traffic Analysis

- Real-time traffic pattern analysis
- Anomaly detection and alerting
- DDoS attack protection
- Bot detection and mitigation
- Usage analytics and reporting

## Dynamic Scaling

- Auto-scaling based on traffic patterns
- Load balancing optimization
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Graceful degradation strategies

## Security Features

- Suspicious activity detection
- IP blocking and whitelisting
- JWT token validation
- Request signature verification

## Trigger Events

- `api-request`: On every API request for rate limit checks
- `rate-limit-exceeded`: When user exceeds allowed rate
- `suspicious-activity`: When unusual patterns detected
- `traffic-spike`: When traffic increases rapidly

## Configuration

```json
{
  "rate-limit-per-minute": 100,
  "burst-capacity": 20,
  "block-duration": "1h",
  "whitelist-ips": ["192.168.1.1", "10.0.0.1"],
  "geographic-limits": {
    "US": 1000,
    "EU": 800,
    "default": 500
  }
}
```

## Actions

### apply-rate-limit
