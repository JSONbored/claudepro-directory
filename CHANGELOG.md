- SEO and Structured Data:
  - Metadata registry, derivation rules, and JSON-LD (HowTo/CreativeWork/SourceCode when examples exist).
  - LLMs.txt inclusion for category and item routes.
- Routing and UI:
  - Category configs and content-type configs (sections: Guide, Installation, Examples, Troubleshooting).
  - Navigation link with "New" indicator (moved from Statuslines/Collections to Skills).
- APIs and Search:
  - `/api/skills.json` and search index generation.
  - Sitemap/URL generator now includes skills.
- Validation and CI:
  - Content validator updated for `skills`.
  - Security validators/regex and content-validation workflow updated.
  - LLMs.txt validator includes skills routes.

## 2025-10-13 - Collections Category System Consolidation

**TL;DR:** Consolidated Collections into the unified dynamic category routing system alongside Agents, MCP Servers, Rules, Commands, Hooks, and Statuslines. Collections now benefit from uniform handling across the entire platform while maintaining all specialized features like nested collections, prerequisites, installation order, and compatibility tracking.

### What Changed

Integrated Collections as a first-class content category within the platform's dynamic routing architecture. Previously, Collections used custom routes (`/collections` and `/collections/[slug]`). Now they follow the same pattern as other main categories (`/[category]` and `/[category]/[slug]`), enabling uniform treatment across search, caching, analytics, and all platform features.

### Changed

- **Dynamic Routing Architecture**
  - Collections now use `[category]` dynamic routes instead of custom `/collections` routes
  - Created `CollectionDetailView` component for specialized collection rendering
  - Enhanced `ConfigCard` to display collection-specific badges (collection type, difficulty, item count)
  - Added tree-shakeable collection logic that only loads when `category === 'collections'`
  - Deleted 3 obsolete custom route files (`collections/page.tsx`, `collections/[slug]/page.tsx`, `collections/[slug]/llms.txt/route.ts`)

- **Schema & Type Safety**
  - Added collection-specific properties to `UnifiedContentItem` schema (collectionType, items, prerequisites, installationOrder, compatibility)
  - Enabled nested collections support (collections can now reference other collections)
  - Updated `ContentType` unions across 6 components to include 'collections'
  - Enhanced submission stats schema to track collection contributions

- **Platform Integration**
  - **Caching**: Added collections to Redis trending cleanup and cache invalidation logic
  - **Search**: Added collections to search filtering and API validation schemas
  - **Related Content**: Collections now receive same visibility boost as other main categories
  - **Service Worker**: Added collections to offline caching regex patterns
  - **Submit Form**: Users can now submit collections through the web interface
  - **Analytics**: Collection submissions tracked in community leaderboards

- **SEO & Metadata**
  - Removed redundant `/collections` hardcoded routes from metadata registry
  - Collections now handled by unified `/:category` and `/:category/:slug` metadata patterns
  - Maintains all SEO optimizations with cleaner, more maintainable architecture

- **Testing & Validation**
  - Added collections to E2E test coverage (accessibility, SEO, llms.txt generation)
  - Updated content validation scripts to verify collections discovery
  - Added collections to sitemap parity tests

### Technical Details

The consolidation involved 27 file modifications across routing, schemas, caching, security, UI components, and tests. All changes follow the codebase's core principles of consolidation, DRY, type safety, and configuration-driven architecture. Collections retain all unique features (CollectionDetailView with embedded items, prerequisites section, installation order, compatibility matrix) while benefiting from uniform platform integration.

**Key architectural improvements:**
- Reduced code duplication by ~150 lines through route consolidation
- Eliminated maintenance burden of parallel routing systems
- Enabled future collection features to automatically work with existing platform capabilities
- Improved type safety with proper Zod schema integration throughout

### Technical Implementation

**Navigation Configuration Pattern:**
```typescript
export const PRIMARY_NAVIGATION: NavigationLink[] = [
  {
    label: 'Statuslines',
    href: '/statuslines',
    icon: Monitor,
    description: 'Editor status bar configs',
    isNew: true,
  },
  // ... more links
];

export const SECONDARY_NAVIGATION: NavigationSection[] = [
  {
    heading: 'Discover',
    links: [
      {
        label: 'For You',
        href: '/for-you',
        icon: Sparkles,
        description: 'Personalized recommendations',
      },
      // ... more links
    ],
  },
];
```

**Announcement Configuration:**
```typescript
{
  id: 'statuslines-launch-2025-10',
  variant: 'default',
  tag: 'New',
  title: 'Introducing Statuslines - Customize your editor status bar',
  href: '/statuslines',
  icon: 'ArrowUpRight',
  startDate: '2025-10-10T00:00:00Z',
  endDate: '2025-10-17T23:59:59Z',
  priority: 'high',
  dismissible: true,
}
```

**Command Menu Usage:**
- Press ⌘K/Ctrl+K anywhere on the site
- Type to search (e.g., "agents", "trending", "submit")
- Arrow keys to navigate results
- Enter to navigate to selected item
- Escape to close menu

**Dismissal Hook:**
```tsx
const { isDismissed, dismiss, reset, getDismissalTime } = useAnnouncementDismissal('announcement-id');

// Check if dismissed
if (!isDismissed) {
  // Show announcement
}

// Dismiss announcement
dismiss(); // Stores timestamp in localStorage

// Reset dismissal
reset(); // Removes from localStorage

// Get dismissal time
const timestamp = getDismissalTime(); // Returns ISO string or null
```

### Performance Impact

- **Navigation Rendering:** No performance change (same JSX, just config-driven)
- **Command Menu:** Lazy loaded (not rendered until ⌘K pressed)
- **Announcement Banner:** Conditional rendering (null if no active announcement)
- **localStorage:** Synchronous reads/writes (minimal impact, <1ms)
- **Bundle Size:** +8KB (Command dialog + announcement components)

### Accessibility Features (WCAG 2.1 AA)

- **Keyboard Navigation:**
  - ⌘K/Ctrl+K: Global command palette
  - Tab: Navigate interactive elements
  - Arrow keys: Dropdown menu navigation
  - Enter/Space: Activate links/buttons
  - Escape: Close menus and dismiss announcements

- **Screen Reader Support:**
  - aria-current="page" on active links
  - aria-label on icon buttons and navigation landmarks
  - Screen reader announcements for new indicators
  - Semantic HTML structure

- **Visual Accessibility:**
  - Focus visible indicators (ring-2, ring-accent)
  - Reduced motion support (motion-reduce:animate-none)
  - High contrast borders and colors
  - Touch targets 44×44px minimum

### For Contributors

**Adding New Navigation Links:**

```typescript
// src/config/navigation.ts

// Primary navigation
export const PRIMARY_NAVIGATION: NavigationLink[] = [
  // ... existing links
  {
    label: 'Your New Category',
    href: '/new-category',
    icon: YourIcon,
    description: 'Description for command menu',
    isNew: true, // Optional: Shows pulsing dot
  },
];

// Secondary navigation (dropdown)
export const SECONDARY_NAVIGATION: NavigationSection[] = [
  {
    heading: 'Your Section',
    links: [
      {
        label: 'Your Link',
        href: '/your-link',
        icon: YourIcon,
        description: 'Short description',
      },
    ],
  },
];
```

**Adding Announcements:**

```typescript
// src/config/announcements.ts

export const announcements: AnnouncementConfig[] = [
  {
    id: 'unique-announcement-id-2025-10',
    variant: 'default', // default | outline | secondary | destructive
    tag: 'New', // Optional badge
    title: 'Your announcement text (max 100 chars recommended)',
    href: '/optional-link', // Optional
    icon: 'ArrowUpRight', // Optional Lucide icon name
    startDate: '2025-10-10T00:00:00Z',
    endDate: '2025-10-17T23:59:59Z',
    priority: 'high', // high | medium | low
    dismissible: true, // false for critical alerts
  },
];
```

**Announcement Priority Rules:**
1. Only ONE announcement shows at a time
2. Must be within start/end date range
3. Highest priority wins (high > medium > low)
4. Most recent startDate if same priority
5. Dismissal state tracked per-user in localStorage

**Testing Navigation Changes:**
- Verify links work in all contexts (desktop nav, mobile menu, command menu)
- Test keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Escape, ⌘K)
- Check screen reader announcements
- Validate responsive behavior (mobile + desktop)
- Ensure new indicators appear correctly

## 2025-10-09 - Hero Section Animations and Search Enhancements

**TL;DR:** Transformed the homepage with dynamic meteor background animations, character-by-character rolling text effects, and streamlined search UI. These enhancements create a more engaging first impression while improving search discoverability and reducing visual clutter.

### What Changed

Redesigned the hero section with modern animations and refined the search experience. The homepage now features a subtle meteor shower effect, smooth text transitions, and a cleaner search interface that emphasizes content discovery over filtering options.

### Added

- **Meteor Background Animation** (`src/components/ui/magic/meteors.tsx`)
  - Animated shooting stars effect across hero section
  - 20 meteors with randomized timing and positioning
  - Constrained to above-the-fold viewport (max-h-screen)
  - GPU-accelerated CSS animations for 60fps performance
  - Comet-style design with gradient tails and accent color glow
  - Configurable angle (35°), speed (3-8s), and delay (0-3s)

- **Rolling Text Animation** (`src/components/ui/magic/rolling-text.tsx`)
  - Character-by-character 3D rotation effect (shadcn-style)
  - Cycles through words: enthusiasts → developers → power users → beginners → builders
  - Hardware-accelerated transforms with proper perspective
  - Smooth easing with custom cubic-bezier curve [0.16, 1, 0.3, 1]
  - 600ms rotation duration with 50ms character delays
  - Accessibility support with screen reader announcements

### Changed

- **Search Bar Enhancement**
  - Prominent orange search icon (h-5 w-5) positioned left with z-10 layering
  - Increased input height from 12 to 14 (h-14) for better touch targets
  - Accent color focus border (focus:border-accent/50)
  - Improved spacing with pl-12 padding for icon clearance

- **Hero Section Layout** (`src/app/page.tsx`)
  - Moved search bar closer to hero text (pt-8 pb-12)
  - Removed sort/filter controls from homepage search
  - Cleaner first impression with focus on search discovery
  - Sort and filter remain available on category pages

### Fixed

- **Rolling Text Hydration** - Prevented SSR/client mismatch by rendering static placeholder during server-side rendering
- **Linting Compliance** - Resolved array index key warnings with unique character IDs
- **Supabase Mock Client** - Added proper biome-ignore comments for intentional development warnings

### Technical Implementation

**Meteor Animation System:**
```typescript
<Meteors
  number={20}
  minDelay={0}
  maxDelay={3}
  minDuration={3}
  maxDuration={8}
  angle={35}
/>
```

**Character Animation:**
- Each character rotates independently with rotateX transforms
- Entry: rotateX(90deg) → rotateX(0deg)
- Exit: rotateX(0deg) → rotateX(90deg)
- Transform origin: bottom center for natural rolling effect

**Search Icon Positioning:**
```tsx
<div className="absolute left-4 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 pointer-events-none z-10">
  <Search className="h-5 w-5 text-accent" />
</div>
```

### Performance Impact

- **Meteor Animation:** Pure CSS transforms, no JavaScript during animation
- **Rolling Text:** Framer Motion with GPU acceleration
- **Layout Shift:** Zero CLS with fixed container dimensions
- **Accessibility:** ARIA live regions for text changes, reduced motion support

### For Contributors

When implementing similar animations:

```tsx
// ✅ Constrain animations to viewport
<div className="absolute inset-0 max-h-screen">
  <YourAnimation />
</div>

// ✅ Prevent hydration mismatches
const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => setIsMounted(true), []);

// ✅ Use stable keys for animated lists
characters.map((item) => (
  <motion.span key={item.id}>
    {item.char}
  </motion.span>
))
```

  - Added data attributes (`data-grid-item`, `data-grid-content`) for layout calculation
  - Integrated ResizeObserver for dynamic content height tracking
  - Removed `gridClassName` prop in favor of consistent masonry implementation

- **Infinite Scroll Hook** (`src/hooks/use-infinite-scroll.ts`)
  - Enhanced useEffect dependencies to include `hasMore` and `loading` states
  - Added proper IntersectionObserver cleanup on state changes
  - Observer now recreates when pagination conditions change
  - Improved type safety with observerRef tracking

### Technical Implementation

**Masonry Layout Calculation:**
```typescript
const rowGap = 24; // gap-6 = 24px
const rowHeight = 1; // Fine-grained control
const contentHeight = content.getBoundingClientRect().height;
const rowSpan = Math.ceil((contentHeight + rowGap) / (rowHeight + rowGap));
```

**Observer Lifecycle:**
- Observer creates when element mounts AND `hasMore && !loading`
- Observer destroys and recreates when loading/pagination states change
- Prevents stale observers from blocking new content loads
- Zero memory leaks with comprehensive cleanup

### Performance Impact

- **Visual Quality:** 95% reduction in spacing variance (34px → 1px granularity)
- **Scroll Reliability:** 100% success rate loading all available content
- **Browser Compatibility:** ResizeObserver supported in all modern browsers
- **Memory Usage:** Proper observer cleanup prevents accumulation

### For Contributors

When working with card grids:

```tsx
// ✅ Grid items must use data attributes for masonry
<div data-grid-item>
  <div data-grid-content>
    <YourCard />
  </div>
</div>

// ✅ Grid container uses masonry classes
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-6 auto-rows-[1px]">
```

When implementing infinite scroll:

```typescript
// ✅ Pass loading and hasMore to hook
const observerTarget = useInfiniteScroll(loadMore, {
  hasMore,
  loading,
  threshold: 0.1,
  rootMargin: '200px',
});

// ✅ Conditionally render target element
{!loading && hasMore && <div ref={observerTarget} />}
```

## 2025-10-09 - Enhanced Type Safety with Branded Types and Schema Improvements

**TL;DR:** Implemented branded types for user/session/content IDs with compile-time safety, centralized input sanitization transforms into 13 reusable functions, and enhanced schema validation across the personalization engine. These changes improve type safety, eliminate duplicate code, and provide better protection against ID mixing bugs.

### What Changed

Major refactoring to enhance type safety and schema validation across the platform. Introduced branded types using Zod's nominal typing feature to prevent ID confusion at compile time, consolidated duplicate input sanitization logic, and improved validation consistency throughout the codebase.

### Added

- **Branded Types for IDs** (`src/lib/schemas/branded-types.schema.ts`)
  - `UserId` - UUID-validated branded type for user identifiers
  - `SessionId` - UUID-validated branded type for session identifiers
  - `ContentId` - Slug-validated branded type for content identifiers (alphanumeric with hyphens)
  - Helper functions: `createUserId()`, `createSessionId()`, `toContentId(slug)`
  - Compile-time prevention of mixing IDs from different domains
  - Runtime validation ensures correct format (UUID vs slug patterns)
  - Zero runtime overhead with Zod's brand feature

- **Centralized Input Sanitization** (`src/lib/schemas/primitives/sanitization-transforms.ts`)
  - 13 reusable transform functions replacing 11+ inline duplicates
  - `normalizeEmail()` - RFC 5322 compliant email normalization
  - `normalizeString()` - Lowercase + trim for consistent storage
  - `trimString()`, `trimOptionalString()`, `trimOptionalStringOrEmpty()` - String cleanup variants
  - `stringToBoolean()` - Handles common truthy/falsy string representations
  - `parseContentType()` - Extracts base content type from HTTP headers
  - Security-focused: Null byte checks, path traversal prevention, injection protection
  - Single source of truth for all input sanitization

- **Cursor Pagination Schema** (`src/lib/schemas/primitives/cursor-pagination.schema.ts`)
  - Type-safe cursor-based pagination for scalable API endpoints
  - Opaque cursor implementation for security
  - Configurable page sizes with validation

- **Unified SEO Title Verification** (`scripts/verify-titles.ts`)
  - Consolidated 3 separate scripts into single comprehensive tool
  - Validates all titles across agents, MCP servers, rules, commands, hooks, statuslines, collections, and guides
  - Checks for empty titles, duplicates, and SEO optimization
  - Detailed reporting with color-coded output

### Changed

- **Personalization Schemas** (6 schemas updated)
  - `userInteractionSchema` - Now uses `userIdSchema`, `contentIdSchema`, `sessionIdSchema`
  - `affinityScoreSchema` - Uses branded types for user and content identification
  - `userSimilaritySchema` - Uses `userIdSchema` for both user_a_id and user_b_id
  - `contentSimilaritySchema` - Uses `contentIdSchema` for content slugs
  - `personalizedRecommendationSchema` - Slug field now ContentId type
  - All analytics event schemas updated with branded types

- **Schema Consolidation** (5 files refactored)
  - `newsletter.schema.ts` - Replaced inline transform with `normalizeEmail()`
  - `analytics.schema.ts` - Replaced inline transform with `normalizeString()`
  - `middleware.schema.ts` - Replaced complex parsing with `parseContentType()`
  - `form.schema.ts` - Replaced 4 inline transforms with centralized functions
  - `search.schema.ts` - Replaced 7 inline transforms (4 trim + 3 boolean conversions)

- **Database Actions** (6 files updated)
  - `follow-actions.ts` - Uses `userIdSchema` in followSchema with validation
  - `interaction-actions.ts` - Converts database strings to branded types at boundaries
  - `personalization-actions.ts` - All recommendation responses use `toContentId()` conversion
  - `affinity-scorer.ts` - Affinity calculations use ContentId type
  - Type-safe boundaries between database (plain strings) and application (branded types)
  - Proper validation at conversion points

- **Build Scripts** (4 scripts improved)
  - Migrated 65+ console statements to structured production logger
  - `generate-openapi.ts` - 20 console statements → logger with metadata
  - `validate-llmstxt.ts` - 27 console statements → structured logging
  - `optimize-titles.ts` - 15 console statements → logger with structured data
  - `generate-sitemap.ts` - Added alphabetical URL sorting for better git diffs
  - Consistent logging format across all build tools

### Removed

- **Legacy Configuration Files**
  - `config/tools/lighthouserc.json` - Redundant (kept production .cjs version)
  - `config/tools/depcheck.json` - Unused tool configuration

- **Duplicate Scripts**
  - `scripts/verify-all-titles.ts` - Functionality merged into verify-titles.ts
  - `scripts/verify-seo-titles.ts` - Consolidated into unified verification script

### Fixed

- **Linting Issues** (6 issues resolved)
  - Removed unused `colors` constant from validate-llmstxt.ts (proper deletion vs suppression)
  - Fixed proper error logging in catch blocks (2 instances)
  - Added missing `existsSync` import in submit-indexnow.ts
  - Added explicit type annotation for stat variable
  - Used template literals for string concatenation in optimize-titles.ts
  - All fixes follow production-ready principles (no suppression with underscores)

### Technical Implementation

**Branded Type Pattern:**
```typescript
// Schema definition
export const contentIdSchema = nonEmptyString
  .max(200)
  .regex(/^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$/)
  .brand<'ContentId'>();

export type ContentId = z.infer<typeof contentIdSchema>;

// Helper function for conversion
export function toContentId(slug: string): ContentId {
  return contentIdSchema.parse(slug);
}

// Usage in schemas
const interactionSchema = z.object({
  content_slug: contentIdSchema, // Validated at schema level
});

// Conversion at boundaries
const recommendations = items.map(item => ({
  slug: toContentId(item.slug), // Convert database string to branded type
}));
```

**Sanitization Transform Pattern:**
```typescript
// Before: Inline duplicate code (11+ instances)
email: z.string().email().transform((val) => val.toLowerCase().trim())

// After: Centralized reusable function
import { normalizeEmail } from './primitives/sanitization-transforms';
email: z.string().email().transform(normalizeEmail)
```

### Code Quality

- **Linting:** 582 files checked, 0 errors, 0 warnings
- **TypeScript:** 0 type errors with strict mode enabled
- **Build:** Production build successful
- **Testing:** All type-safe conversions verified at boundaries

### Performance

- **Zero Runtime Overhead:** Branded types are compile-time only (nominal typing)
- **Sitemap Generation:** Alphabetical sorting improves git diff performance
- **Logger Migration:** Structured logging enables better observability without performance penalty

### Security

- **ID Mixing Prevention:** Compile-time errors when using wrong ID type
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs sanitized through centralized transforms
- **Format Enforcement:** Runtime validation of UUID and slug patterns
- **Null Byte Protection:** Sanitization transforms check for injection attempts

### Impact

- **Type Safety:** 53 occurrences of user/session/content IDs now type-checked at compile time
- **Code Reduction:** ~100+ lines of duplicate transform code eliminated
- **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for input sanitization
- **Developer Experience:** Better IDE autocomplete and error messages with branded types
- **Production Ready:** All changes follow strict validation and logging standards

### For Contributors

When working with user/session/content identifiers:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Use branded types in schemas
import { userIdSchema, contentIdSchema } from '@/lib/schemas/branded-types.schema';

const schema = z.object({
  user_id: userIdSchema,
  content_slug: contentIdSchema,
});

// ✅ Correct: Convert at boundaries
import { toContentId } from '@/lib/schemas/branded-types.schema';

const contentId = toContentId(databaseSlug); // Validates and converts

// ❌ Incorrect: Don't mix ID types
const userId: UserId = sessionId; // Compile-time error!
```

When adding input sanitization:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct: Use centralized transforms
import { normalizeEmail, trimString } from '@/lib/schemas/primitives/sanitization-transforms';

email: z.string().email().transform(normalizeEmail)

// ❌ Incorrect: Don't write inline transforms
email: z.string().email().transform((val) => val.toLowerCase().trim())
```

## 2025-10-08 - React 19 Component Migration for shadcn/ui

**TL;DR:** Migrated 6 shadcn/ui components (15 total component instances) from deprecated React.forwardRef pattern to React 19's ref-as-prop pattern, eliminating all forwardRef deprecation warnings while maintaining full type safety and functionality.

### What Changed

Comprehensive migration of shadcn/ui components to React 19 standards, removing all uses of the deprecated `React.forwardRef` API in favor of the new ref-as-prop pattern. This modernizes the component library while preserving 100% backward compatibility and type safety.

### Fixed

- **React 19 Deprecation Warnings** (15 warnings eliminated)
  - Removed all `React.forwardRef` usage across UI components
  - Converted to React 19's ref-as-prop pattern (refs passed as regular props)
  - Zero runtime overhead - purely signature changes
  - All components maintain identical functionality and behavior
  - Full TypeScript type safety preserved with proper ref typing

### Changed

- **Avatar Components** (`src/components/ui/avatar.tsx`)
  - Converted 3 components: Avatar, AvatarImage, AvatarFallback
  - Ref now passed as optional prop: `ref?: React.Ref<React.ElementRef<typeof AvatarPrimitive.Root>>`
  - All Radix UI primitive integrations maintained

- **Checkbox Component** (`src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx`)
  - Single component conversion with CheckboxPrimitive.Root integration
  - Preserved all accessibility features and visual states

- **Command Components** (`src/components/ui/command.tsx`)
  - Converted 7 components: Command, CommandInput, CommandList, CommandEmpty, CommandGroup, CommandSeparator, CommandItem
  - Largest refactor - maintained cmdk integration and dialog functionality

- **Radio Group Components** (`src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx`)
  - Converted 2 components: RadioGroup, RadioGroupItem
  - Preserved indicator logic and Lucide icon integration

- **Separator Component** (`src/components/ui/separator.tsx`)
  - Single component with default parameter preservation (orientation, decorative)
  - Maintained horizontal/vertical orientation logic

- **Switch Component** (`src/components/ui/switch.tsx`)
  - Converted Switch with SwitchPrimitives.Thumb integration
  - All data-state attributes and animations preserved

### Technical Implementation

**Before (Deprecated React.forwardRef):**
```tsx
const Component = React.forwardRef<
  React.ElementRef<typeof Primitive>,
  React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Primitive>
>(({ className, ...props }, ref) => (
  <Primitive ref={ref} className={cn(/* ... */)} {...props} />
));
Component.displayName = Primitive.displayName;
```

**After (React 19 Ref-as-Prop):**
```tsx
const Component = ({
  className,
  ref,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Primitive> & {
  ref?: React.Ref<React.ElementRef<typeof Primitive>>;
}) => (
  <Primitive ref={ref} className={cn(/* ... */)} {...props} />
);
Component.displayName = Primitive.displayName;
```

**Type Safety Pattern:**
- Maintained `React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Primitive>` for all props
- Added intersection type: `& { ref?: React.Ref<...> }` for optional ref
- Preserved `React.ElementRef<typeof Primitive>` for exact ref typing
- All components remain fully type-safe with strict TypeScript mode

**Files Modified (6 files, 15 component instances):**
- `src/components/ui/avatar.tsx` - 3 components (Avatar, AvatarImage, AvatarFallback)
- `src/components/ui/checkbox.tsx` - 1 component (Checkbox)
- `src/components/ui/command.tsx` - 7 components (Command, CommandInput, CommandList, CommandEmpty, CommandGroup, CommandSeparator, CommandItem)
- `src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx` - 2 components (RadioGroup, RadioGroupItem)
- `src/components/ui/separator.tsx` - 1 component (Separator)
- `src/components/ui/switch.tsx` - 1 component (Switch)

**Import Optimization:**
- Auto-formatter converted all `import * as React` to `import type * as React`
- React only used for type annotations, not runtime values
- Cleaner imports that get stripped at compile time

### Code Quality

- **Linting:** 0 warnings (verified with `npm run lint` - 580 files checked)
- **TypeScript:** 0 errors (verified with `npm run type-check`)
- **Build:** Production build successful (425 static pages generated)
- **Performance:** React.memo() optimizations preserved on relevant components
- **Testing:** All components render identically to previous implementation

### Impact

- **Zero Breaking Changes:** All components maintain exact same API and behavior
- **Future-Proof:** Aligned with React 19 best practices and official migration guide
- **Maintainability:** Simpler component signatures without forwardRef wrapper
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript inference preserved with proper ref typing
- **Production Ready:** All quality checks passed (lint, type-check, build)

### For Contributors

When creating new shadcn/ui components, use the React 19 ref-as-prop pattern:

```tsx
const MyComponent = ({
  className,
  ref,
  ...props
}: React.ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof Primitive> & {
  ref?: React.Ref<React.ElementRef<typeof Primitive>>;
}) => (
  <Primitive ref={ref} className={cn(/* ... */)} {...props} />
);
```

**Do not use** `React.forwardRef` - it's deprecated in React 19.

Run `npm run lint` and `npm run type-check` before committing to ensure compliance.

### Changed

- Bookmark actions now track interactions for affinity calculation
- View tracking enhanced with user interaction logging
- Copy actions record interaction events for scoring
- Account library shows personalized recommendations
- Navigation includes "For You" link for authenticated users

### Technical Implementation

**Database Schema:**

```sql
-- User interactions (clickstream)
user_interactions (user_id, content_type, content_slug, interaction_type, metadata, created_at)

-- Affinity scores (precomputed)
user_affinities (user_id, content_type, content_slug, affinity_score, based_on, calculated_at)

-- Similarity matrices
user_similarities (user_a_id, user_b_id, similarity_score, common_items, calculated_at)
content_similarities (content_a_type, content_a_slug, content_b_type, content_b_slug, similarity_score, similarity_factors, calculated_at)
```

**Affinity Scoring Formula:**

```typescript
affinity = (
  normalize(views, max=10) * 0.20 +
  normalize(time_spent, max=300s) * 0.25 +
  normalize(bookmarks, max=1) * 0.30 +
  normalize(copies, max=3) * 0.15 +
  recency_decay() * 0.10
) * 100

recency_decay = exp(-ln(2) * days_since / 30)
```

**For You Feed Algorithm:**

```typescript
final_score = (
  affinity_based * 0.40 +
  collaborative * 0.30 +
  trending * 0.15 +
  interest_match * 0.10 +
  diversity_bonus * 0.05
)
```

**Collaborative Filtering:**

- Jaccard similarity: `intersection(users) / union(users)`
- Co-bookmark matrix normalized by min(item_a_count, item_b_count)
- Item-based approach (stable for sparse data)

**Recommendation Scoring Logic:**
```typescript
// Multi-factor weighted scoring (must sum to 1.0)
weights = {
  useCase: 0.35,        // Primary driver
  toolPreference: 0.20, // Category preference
  experience: 0.15,     // Complexity filtering
  integrations: 0.15,   // Required tools
  focusAreas: 0.10,     // Fine-tuning
  popularity: 0.03,     // Community signal
  trending: 0.02,       // Discovery boost
}
```

## 2025-10-05 - Homepage Infinite Scroll Bug Fix

**TL;DR:** Fixed critical bug where homepage "All" section stopped loading after 60 items due to state synchronization issues between parent and InfiniteScrollContainer component.

### Fixed

- **60-Item Pagination Cap**
  - Root cause: Dual state management creating race condition
  - InfiniteScrollContainer maintained local `allItems` state
  - Parent's useEffect was resetting state on every `filteredResults` reference change
  - Solution: Made InfiniteScrollContainer fully controlled (stateless)

- **State Synchronization**
  - Removed `allItems` state from InfiniteScrollContainer
  - Component now uses `items` prop directly (single source of truth)
  - Eliminated useEffect that was overwriting accumulated items
  - Fixed race condition between `loadMore` and `useEffect`

- **Pagination Reset Loop**
  - Changed useEffect dependency from `filteredResults` to `[activeTab, isSearching]`
  - Prevents reset when same data is re-filtered (array reference changes)
  - Only resets pagination when user actually changes tabs or search state
  - Added biome-ignore with detailed explanation for linter

### Changed

- **InfiniteScrollContainer Architecture**
  - Converted from stateful to fully controlled component
  - Parent component (`home/index.tsx`) now manages all state
  - Infinite scroll container just renders + triggers loading
  - Better separation of concerns and predictable behavior

- **Load More Button**
  - Set `showLoadMoreButton={false}` for seamless infinite scroll
  - Users now get automatic loading as they scroll
  - More modern UX (no manual clicking required)

**Files Modified:**

- `src/components/shared/infinite-scroll-container.tsx`
- `src/components/features/home/index.tsx`
- `src/components/features/home/tabs-section.tsx`

## 2025-10-04 - LLMs.txt Complete Content Generation for AI Discovery

**TL;DR:** All 168 content pages now generate comprehensive llms.txt files with 100% of page content (features, installation, configuration, security, examples) optimized for AI tool discovery and LLM consumption.

### What Changed

Implemented production-grade llms.txt generation system following the [llmstxt.org specification](https://llmstxt.org) (Oct 2025 standards). Each content item now exports ALL structured fields to AI-friendly plain text format with zero truncation, PII sanitization, and type-safe content building.

### Added

- **Type-Safe Rich Content Builder** (`src/lib/llms-txt/content-builder.ts`)
  - Extracts ALL fields from 6 content schemas (MCP, Agent, Hook, Command, Rule, Statusline)
  - Formats installation instructions (Claude Desktop + Claude Code)
  - Formats configurations (MCP servers, hook scripts, statusline settings)
  - Includes security best practices, troubleshooting guides, and usage examples
  - No `any` types - fully type-safe with proper narrowing

  - `COPY_MARKDOWN` event tracking with content metadata
  - `DOWNLOAD_MARKDOWN` event tracking with file size metrics
  - Integrated into CopyMarkdownButton and DownloadMarkdownButton components
  - Umami analytics for user interaction insights

### Changed

- **Removed ALL truncation** from llms.txt schema and routes
  - `llmsTxtItemSchema`: Removed artificial 200/1000 char limits on title/description
  - Collections route: Uses `content` field (unlimited) instead of `description` (1000 chars)
  - Item detail route: Includes full rich content via `buildRichContent()`

- **Content Coverage**
  - BEFORE: ~5% of page content (1-sentence description only)
  - AFTER: 100% of page content (15x improvement)
  - MCP servers now include full configuration examples, environment variables, installation steps

## 2025-10-04 - SEO Title Optimization System with Automated Enhancement

**TL;DR:** Optimized 59 page titles with automated "for Claude" branding while staying under 60-character SEO limits. Added validation tools and developer utilities for ongoing title management.

### What Changed

Implemented dual-title metadata system allowing separate SEO-optimized titles (`seoTitle`) and user-facing headings (`title`). Created automated enhancement utilities that intelligently add "for Claude" branding while respecting category-specific character budgets (23-31 available chars depending on suffix length).

### Added

- `seoTitle` optional field to all content schemas (agents, mcp, rules, commands, hooks, statuslines, collections, guides)
- Build pipeline support: `seoTitle` flows from source files → static API → page metadata
- Developer utilities:
  - `npm run validate:titles` - Check all page titles against 60-char limit
  - `npm run optimize:titles:dry` - Preview automated enhancements
  - `npm run optimize:titles` - Apply enhancements to source files
- `src/lib/seo/title-enhancer.ts` - Smart slug-to-title conversion with acronym/brand handling
- `src/lib/config/seo-config.ts` - Centralized SEO constants and character budgets

### Changed

- Enhanced 59 content files (35.1% of catalog) with optimized `seoTitle` fields:
  - MCP servers: 34/40 (85%) - "GitHub MCP Server for Claude"
  - Commands: 12/12 (100%) - "Debug Command for Claude"
  - Rules: 6/11 (54.5%)
  - Hooks: 6/60 (10%)
  - Agents: 1/10 (10%)
- Updated `scripts/verify-all-titles.ts` to single-line compact output format
- Added `seoTitle` to metadata extraction in `build-category-config.ts`

### Technical Implementation

**Character Budget per Category**:

- Agents: 28 chars | MCP: 31 chars (most space) | Rules: 29 chars
- Commands: 26 chars | Hooks: 29 chars | Statuslines: 23 chars | Collections: 23 chars

**Enhancement Logic**:

```typescript
// Automated "for Claude" suffix with slug fallback
const baseTitle = item.title || item.name || slugToTitle(item.slug);
if (" for Claude".length <= availableSpace) {
  return `${baseTitle} for Claude`;
}
```

**Slug Normalization** - Handles acronyms (API, MCP, AWS, SQL) and brand names (GitHub, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)

### Impact

- **Search Visibility**: 59 pages now have keyword-rich titles optimized for Google/AI search
- **Brand Consistency**: Unified "for Claude" pattern across MCP servers and commands
- **Developer Experience**: On-demand validation and enhancement tools reduce manual work
- **Quality Assurance**: All 168 pages verified under 60-character limit

### For Contributors

When adding new content, optionally include `seoTitle` for SEO optimization:

```json
{
  "slug": "example-server",
  "title": "Example Server - Long Descriptive Name",
  "seoTitle": "Example Server for Claude"
}
```

Run `npm run validate:titles` before submitting to verify character limits.

## 2025-10-04 - Production-Hardened Trending Algorithm with Security & Performance Optimizations

**TL;DR:** Trending content now ranks by growth velocity with UTC-normalized timestamps, input validation, and atomic Redis operations.

### What Changed

The trending tab uses a production-grade growth rate algorithm with security hardening and performance optimizations. Content gaining momentum fast (high percentage growth) ranks higher than content with simply more total views.

### Security Improvements

- **UTC normalization**: All date calculations use UTC to prevent timezone-based data corruption across Vercel edge regions
- **Input validation**: Redis responses validated with `Math.max(0, Number(value))` to prevent negative/invalid values
- **Atomic operations**: Redis pipeline with `EXPIRE NX` flag prevents race conditions on daily key TTL
- **Type safety**: Zod schemas with `.describe()` for JSON Schema compatibility and runtime validation

### Performance Optimizations

- **Batch MGET**: 3 parallel queries (today/yesterday/total) ~10-20% faster than pipeline
- **Smart TTL**: `EXPIRE NX` only sets TTL on first increment, preventing daily TTL refresh
- **UTC calculations**: Eliminates cross-timezone edge function inconsistencies

### Technical Implementation

- **Daily snapshots**: `views:daily:${category}:${slug}:YYYY-MM-DD` Redis keys (UTC dates)
- **Growth formula**: `(today_views - yesterday_views) / yesterday_views * 100`
- **Cold start boost**: New content with first views gets 100% growth rate
- **Smart tie-breakers**: Growth rate → Total views → Static popularity
- **Auto-expiry**: 7-day TTL with `NX` flag prevents unbounded storage

```typescript
// UTC-normalized date calculation (prevents timezone bugs)
const nowUtc = new Date();
const todayStr = nowUtc.toISOString().split("T")[0];

// Input validation (prevents negative/invalid values)
const todayCount = Math.max(0, Number(todayViews[key]) || 0);

// Atomic Redis operations (prevents race conditions)
pipeline.expire(dailyKey, 604800, "NX"); // Only set if key doesn't have TTL
```

### Documentation

- **TSDoc**: Comprehensive documentation with `@param`, `@returns`, `@example`, `@remarks`
- **Zod schemas**: `trendingContentItemSchema` and `trendingOptionsSchema` with `.describe()` metadata
- **Type annotations**: All interfaces properly documented for IDE intellisense

### Impact

- **Security**: No timezone-based data corruption across global edge deployments
- **Reliability**: Input validation prevents invalid Redis data from breaking calculations
- **Performance**: <100ms Redis queries for 200+ items with atomic operations
- **Users**: Discover new popular content on [trending page](https://claudepro.directory/trending) within 24 hours with accurate growth metrics

### Added

- Redis `getDailyViewCounts()` batch method with MGET optimization
- Daily view tracking in `incrementView()` with UTC timestamps
- Growth rate calculation in `getTrendingContent()` with input validation
- Zod schemas for runtime type safety
- Comprehensive TSDoc documentation

### Changed

- **Trending tab**: Now shows highest 24h growth rate (velocity-based) with UTC normalization
- **Popular tab**: Continues showing all-time view counts (cumulative-based)
- View tracking uses Redis pipeline for atomic operations
- All date calculations use UTC instead of local timezone

### Fixed

- **Timezone bug**: Date calculations now use UTC to prevent inconsistencies across regions
- **Race condition**: Daily key TTL only set once using `EXPIRE NX` flag
- **Invalid data**: All Redis responses validated before calculations

### Site-Wide Implementation

- **Homepage enrichment**: All 7 content categories (agents, mcp, rules, commands, hooks, statuslines, collections) enriched with Redis view counts
- **Category pages**: Dynamic `[category]` route enriches items before rendering
- **Guides pages**: MDX-based guides (/guides/tutorials, etc.) now display view counters with compound slug handling
- **ISR revalidation**: 5-minute cache (`revalidate = 300`) for fresh view counts across all pages
- **Helper function**: `statsRedis.enrichWithViewCounts()` for reusable batch view count merging
- **Performance**: 7 parallel MGET calls on homepage (~15-25ms), 1 MGET per category page (~10-15ms)

### Guides Integration

- Extended view counters to all guides pages (/guides, /guides/tutorials, detail pages)
- Handles compound slugs (`tutorials/desktop-mcp-setup`) with prefix stripping for Redis compatibility
- Components updated: EnhancedGuidesPage, CategoryGuidesPage with Eye icon badges
- Schema: Added `viewCount` to guideItemWithCategorySchema

## 2025-10-04 - View Counter UI Redesign with Prominent Badge Display

**TL;DR:** View counts now appear as eye-catching badges on config cards instead of plain text.

### What Changed

Redesigned the view counter display to be more prominent and visually appealing. View counts now appear as primary-colored badges positioned on the bottom-right of config cards with an Eye icon.

### Visual Design

- **Color scheme**: Primary accent (`bg-primary/10 text-primary border-primary/20`)
- **Position**: Bottom-right corner, aligned with action buttons
- **Icon**: Eye icon (3.5x3.5) for instant recognition
- **Hover effect**: Subtle background color change (`hover:bg-primary/15`)
- **Typography**: Medium weight for emphasis

### Implementation

```tsx
<Badge
  variant="secondary"
  className="h-7 px-2.5 gap-1.5 bg-primary/10 text-primary"
>
  <Eye className="h-3.5 w-3.5" />
  <span className="text-xs">{formatViewCount(viewCount)}</span>
</Badge>
```

### Added

- `formatViewCount()` utility with K/M notation (1234 → "1.2K", 1500000 → "1.5M")
- `viewCount` prop to UnifiedDetailPage and DetailMetadata components
- View count fetching in detail page routes

### Changed

- Moved view counter from inline text to standalone badge component
- Falls back to "X% popular" text when Redis data unavailable

### For Users

See view counts displayed prominently on all config cards across [AI Agents](https://claudepro.directory/agents), [MCP Servers](https://claudepro.directory/mcp), and other category pages.

## 2025-10-04 - Trending Page Infinite Loading Fix with ISR

**TL;DR:** Fixed trending page stuck in loading state by enabling ISR with 5-minute revalidation.

### What Was Broken

The trending page used `export const dynamic = 'force-static'` which froze data at build time when Redis was empty. Since Redis only accumulates views after deployment, build-time static generation captured zero data, causing infinite loading states.

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **Static generation**: Page rendered once at build time with empty Redis
2. **No revalidation**: `force-static` prevented refreshing with new data
3. **Wrong Redis check**: `isEnabled()` returned true in fallback mode, blocking fallback logic
4. **Duplicate fetching**: Content fetched twice (trending data + total count separately)

### Solution

- **ISR configuration**: Changed to `export const revalidate = 300` (5-minute refresh)
- **Redis check fix**: Created `isConnected()` method, use instead of `isEnabled()`
- **Performance**: Consolidated duplicate fetching to single Promise.all()

### Fixed

- Infinite loading state on trending page
- Empty tabs due to `isEnabled()` returning true in fallback mode
- Duplicate content fetching (now single consolidated fetch)

### Added

- `statsRedis.isConnected()` method for accurate Redis availability check
- `/trending/loading.tsx` using CategoryLoading factory pattern

### Changed

- Trending page now uses ISR (5-minute revalidation) instead of force-static
- Redis availability check properly detects fallback mode

### Technical Details

```typescript
// Before: Incorrect check (returns true in fallback mode)
if (!statsRedis.isEnabled()) {
  /* fallback */
}

// After: Correct check (only true when actually connected)
if (!statsRedis.isConnected()) {
  /* fallback */
}
```

### For Users

The [trending page](https://claudepro.directory/trending) now loads instantly with accurate data refreshed every 5 minutes.

## 2025-10-04 - Content Security Policy Strict-Dynamic Implementation

**TL;DR:** Fixed React hydration and analytics by adding `'strict-dynamic'` to CSP headers.

### What Changed

Added `'strict-dynamic'` directive to Content Security Policy configuration. This allows nonce-based scripts to dynamically load additional scripts (required for React hydration and third-party analytics).

### Fixed

- **Analytics**: Umami analytics script now loads correctly with CSP nonce
- **View tracking**: `trackView()` server actions no longer blocked by CSP
- **React hydration**: Client-side JavaScript execution now works properly
- **Font loading**: Fixed CSP restrictions blocking web fonts
- **Next.js chunks**: Dynamic chunk loading no longer causes `unsafe-eval` errors

### Added

- `'strict-dynamic'` directive to CSP configuration
- Nonce extraction and application in UmamiScript component
- CSP nonces to all JSON-LD structured data components

### Changed

- Umami script loading strategy: `lazyOnload` → `afterInteractive` (better nonce compatibility)
- Fixed misleading comments claiming Nosecone includes `strict-dynamic` by default

### Technical Details

```typescript
// CSP now allows nonce-based scripts to load additional scripts
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-xyz123' 'strict-dynamic'
```

**Impact**: View tracking analytics now work correctly across the site. See live stats on the [trending page](https://claudepro.directory/trending).

## 2025-10-04 - Submit Form GitHub API Elimination

**TL;DR:** Submission flow now uses GitHub URL pre-filling instead of GitHub API (zero rate limits, zero secrets).

### What Changed

Completely refactored the [submission flow](https://claudepro.directory/submit) to eliminate all GitHub API dependencies. Users now fill the form and get redirected to GitHub with a pre-filled issue they can review before submitting.

### Architecture Improvements

- **Zero secrets**: No GitHub tokens, no environment variables
- **Zero rate limits**: Direct URL navigation instead of API calls
- **Better UX**: Users can review/edit before submission
- **More secure**: Hardcoded repository configuration prevents tampering

### Implementation

New flow: Form → Pre-fill GitHub URL → Redirect → User reviews → Submit

```typescript

## 2025-10-04 - GitHub Actions CI Optimization for Community Contributors

**TL;DR:** Community PRs now trigger only 2 workflows instead of 10, saving ~10-15 minutes per PR.

### What Changed

Optimized GitHub Actions workflows to skip intensive jobs (CI, security scans, Lighthouse, bundle analysis) for community content contributions. Only essential workflows (labeling, validation) run for `content/**/*.json` changes.

### Performance Impact

- **Before**: 10 workflow jobs (~15-20 minutes)
- **After**: 2 workflow jobs (~3-5 minutes)
- **Savings**: ~10-15 minutes per community PR

### Added

- **Automation**: Bundle Analysis workflow (HashiCorp's nextjs-bundle-analysis)
- **Automation**: Lighthouse CI workflow (Core Web Vitals monitoring)
- **Automation**: PR Labeler workflow (19 intelligent labels)
- **Community labels**: 7 contribution types (`community-mcp`, `community-hooks`, etc.)
- **Thresholds**: Lighthouse 90+ performance, 95+ accessibility/SEO

### Changed

- CI, Security, Lighthouse, Bundle Analysis now skip on `content/**/*.json` changes
- Moved `.lighthouserc.json` to `config/tools/lighthouserc.json`

### Fixed

- "Can't find action.yml" errors: Added explicit `actions/checkout@v5` before composite actions
- CI and Security workflows now properly check out repository

## 2025-10-03 - Nosecone CSP Migration & Navigation Menu Fixes

**TL;DR:** Migrated to Nosecone nonce-based CSP for better security and fixed navigation menu centering.

### Added

- Enhanced error boundary logging with error digest tracking
- Comprehensive error context in Vercel logs (user agent, URL, timestamp)

### Changed

- **Security**: Implemented Nosecone nonce-based CSP with `strict-dynamic`
- **Performance**: Migrated from manual CSP to Nosecone defaults extension
- **UI**: Fixed navigation menu centering on xl/2xl screens (reduced excessive gap)

### Fixed

- CSP violations blocking Next.js chunk loading (`unsafe-eval` errors)
- Font loading errors caused by CSP restrictions
- Navigation menu appearing off-center on large screens

### Removed

- Dead code: Inactive ISR `revalidate` exports from 16 files (superseded by dynamic rendering)
