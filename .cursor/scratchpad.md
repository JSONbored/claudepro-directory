# User Profile System - Implementation Analysis

## Background and Motivation

The project requires a comprehensive User Profile System implementation to enable users to:
- Create and customize public profiles
- Upload avatars and manage profile images
- Share bio and interests information
- Track contributions and earn badges
- Build reputation through activity
- Access tiered features (free/pro/enterprise)

This is a critical feature for building community engagement and monetization capabilities.

**Linear Tasks:**
- SHA-2547: Design user profile schema
- SHA-2548: Create public profile pages (/u/[username])
- SHA-2549: Build profile edit UI
- SHA-2550: Add avatar upload (Uploadthing)
- SHA-2551: Implement bio and interests
- SHA-2552: Create contribution history page
- SHA-2553: Build badge system
- SHA-2554: Add reputation scoring
- SHA-2555: Create tier system (free/pro/enterprise)

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current State Assessment (Completed October 7, 2025)

#### ‚úÖ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED

1. **Database Schema (Partial - SHA-2547)**
   - Users table exists with core fields: id, email, name, slug, image, hero, bio, work, website, social_x_link, status, public, follow_email
   - Followers table for social graph (follower/following relationships)
   - RLS policies properly configured
   - Auto-generated slugs from names
   - **Location:** `supabase/schema.sql` (lines 31-47)

2. **Authentication System**
   - Supabase Auth with Google & GitHub OAuth fully functional
   - Auth buttons component: `src/components/auth/auth-buttons.tsx`

   - **Current:** `image` field exists but not populated from OAuth providers
   - **Missing:** Trigger to copy `auth.users.raw_user_meta_data.avatar_url` to `public.users.image`
   - **Better Approach:** Use GitHub/Google OAuth profile pictures (no upload needed!)
   - **Required:** Database trigger to auto-sync OAuth data on signup

   - **Missing:** 
     - Database schema for badges and user_badges tables
     - Badge award logic
     - Badge display components

   - **Current:** Only payment/subscription tables exist for products (jobs, MCPs)
   - **Missing:**
     - User tier field (free/pro/enterprise)
     - Tier-based feature gates
     - Upgrade/downgrade flows
     - Tier benefits documentation
   - **Required:** Complete tier infrastructure

### Architecture Observations

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured Next.js 15 app with App Router
- TypeScript with Zod schemas throughout
- Supabase integration properly configured
- RLS policies in place for security
- Server Actions pattern for mutations
- Consistent UI component library

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 15.5
- React 19.1
- TypeScript 5.9
- Supabase (auth + database)
- Tailwind CSS v4.1
- Zod for validation
- next-safe-action for server actions
- No Uploadthing dependency yet

**Patterns to Follow:**
- Server Actions in `src/lib/actions/*`
- Zod schemas in `src/lib/schemas/*`
- Supabase client patterns (browser/server/admin)
- UI components in `src/components/ui/*`
- Feature components in `src/components/features/*`

### Dependencies Needed

**GOOD NEWS:** No additional dependencies needed!
- ~~`uploadthing`~~ - Not needed! Using OAuth profile pictures instead ‚úÖ
- OAuth providers (GitHub/Google) already provide avatars via Supabase Auth

### Security Considerations

- RLS policies must be updated for new tables (badges, user_badges)
- Profile edit actions need proper authorization checks
- Image uploads require file type/size validation
- Reputation calculations should prevent gaming/abuse
- Tier-based features need server-side enforcement

- [x] Account dashboard
- [x] Follow system (backend complete)
- [x] Bookmarks system

### ‚ùå Blocked
- None currently

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**Status:** Awaiting planner/human user approval to proceed with implementation.

**Questions for User:**
1. Should we implement tasks sequentially or prioritize certain features?
2. Are there any specific design preferences for the UI components?
3. ~~Do you have Uploadthing account/API keys ready?~~ NOT NEEDED - using OAuth pictures! ‚úÖ
4. What should the reputation algorithm prioritize (posts, votes, contributions)?
5. What tier benefits should we implement for free/pro/enterprise?
6. Should profile slugs be changeable or permanent?
7. Should we add custom avatar upload later, or OAuth-only is sufficient?

**Recommendations:**
1. Start with Phase 1 (Database Schema) as foundation
2. Then Phase 3 (OAuth Profile Sync) - **Now super quick!** Just database triggers
3. Then Phase 2 (Profile Edit UI) for immediate user value
4. Phases 4-8 can be done in parallel after foundations complete
5. Consider using TDD approach for server actions and reputation logic

**Major Win:** Eliminating Uploadthing saves significant development time and complexity! üéâ

## Lessons

### Technical Decisions
- Following existing patterns in codebase (server actions, Zod schemas, Supabase)
- Using JSONB for flexible data like interests/tags
- RLS policies must be added for all new tables
- ~~Image uploads should go through Uploadthing~~ ‚ùå 
- **USE OAuth profile pictures from GitHub/Google** ‚úÖ Much simpler and better UX!
- Supabase Auth already provides `raw_user_meta_data.avatar_url` from OAuth providers

### Security Notes
- Always verify user authentication in server actions
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Check ownership before allowing profile edits
- Implement rate limiting on uploads and updates
- Use RLS policies as primary security layer

### Performance Considerations
- Add database indexes for frequently queried fields (slug, tier, reputation_score)
- Paginate contribution history and activity feeds
- Cache reputation calculations
- Optimize badge checking (don't run on every request)

### Key Realizations
- **OAuth Profile Pictures:** User suggested leveraging GitHub/Google OAuth avatars instead of Uploadthing
- This eliminates SHA-2550 entirely and replaces it with a simple database trigger
- Saves 1-2 days of development time and ongoing image storage costs
- Better UX since users already have profile pictures
- Can add custom uploads later if needed, but OAuth should be default

---

**Last Updated:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase - Awaiting Approval
**Major Update:** SHA-2550 revised to use OAuth profile pictures (much simpler approach)
