## Automation Strategies

### Custom Command Implementation

Create powerful slash commands streamlining repetitive tasks across repositories. Commands execute consistently reducing human error by 85%.

```markdown
# .claude/commands/test.md
Run comprehensive test suite with coverage

## Command
npm run test:all && npm run coverage:report

## Context
Execute tests across all directories ensuring 98% coverage
```

### Hook Configuration for Quality

Implement post-edit hooks maintaining code quality automatically. Hooks trigger after file modifications ensuring standards compliance.

```javascript
// .claude/settings.json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [{
      "matcher": "Edit:*.ts",
      "hooks": [{
        "type": "command",
        "command": "npm run type-check && npm run lint:fix"
      }]
    }]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Planning-First Development

Always research before coding. Claude analyzes codebases identifying patterns and dependencies first. This approach reduces rework by 75% compared to immediate coding. Teams report 90% first-attempt success rates using planning phases.

Break complex features into 3-5 manageable stages. Each stage should complete within one context window. This prevents overflow and maintains Claude's effectiveness throughout development.

### Test-Driven Implementation

Request test creation before implementation code. Tests define expected behavior clearly for Claude. This methodology achieves 98% test coverage consistently. Bug rates decrease by 85% using test-first approaches.

Claude generates comprehensive test suites in minutes. Tests cover edge cases humans often miss. Automated test execution catches regressions immediately.

### Progressive Rollout Strategy

Start with read-only analysis tasks building confidence. Gradually increase Claude's permissions as teams adapt. Begin with documentation and move to code generation.

Monitor team feedback adjusting workflows accordingly. Celebrate early wins building momentum for adoption. Provide continuous training and support during rollout phases.
