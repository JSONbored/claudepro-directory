Pro tier aggressively limits extended thinking requests. This fixes token allocation restrictions and prevents workflow interruptions.\n\n**Issue 2: \"Thinking blocks appear as 'redacted_thinking' (5% of responses)\"**\n\n**Solution:** This is normal safety filtering. The final response remains unaffected. Continue using the output as these blocks don't impact quality or accuracy.\n\n**Issue 3: \"Response timeout on requests over 21,333 tokens\"**\n\n**Solution:** Enable streaming for all production requests.
