## Troubleshooting Guide

<UnifiedContentBox contentType="callout" type="warning" title="Common Issues and Solutions">
**Issue 1: "Rate limit exceeded after 2 complex prompts"**

**Solution:** Upgrade from Pro ($20) to Max tier ($100-200/month). Pro tier aggressively limits extended thinking requests. This fixes token allocation restrictions and prevents workflow interruptions.

**Issue 2: "Thinking blocks appear as 'redacted_thinking' (5% of responses)"**

**Solution:** This is normal safety filtering. The final response remains unaffected. Continue using the output as these blocks don't impact quality or accuracy.

**Issue 3: "Response timeout on requests over 21,333 tokens"**

**Solution:** Enable streaming for all production requests. Streaming is mandatory for extended thinking to prevent timeouts and provide real-time feedback.
</Callout>

## Advanced Techniques

<UnifiedContentBox contentType="callout" type="tip" title="Professional Tips">
**Performance Optimization:** Combine Sonnet 4 for routine tasks with selective Opus 4.1 deployment reduces costs by 60-70% while maintaining output quality. GitHub and Cursor use this hybrid approach.

**Security Best Practice:** Always preserve thinking blocks in multi-turn conversations for audit trails. Never modify or reorder thinking sequences as this causes API validation errors.

**Scalability Pattern:** For enterprise deployments like Carlyle Group's 50% accuracy improvements, implement four-tier access control (Read-Only, Command, Write, Admin) with thinking budget limits per tier.

This progression teaches tool orchestration and enables the multi-hour coding sessions that Rakuten uses. The natural learning path is: Extended Thinking API â†’ MCP Integration â†’ Production Scaling â†’ Autonomous Agents.",

    {
      question: "How can I optimize costs for production deployment?",
      answer: "Implement three-tier optimization: Use Sonnet 4 ($15/M) for 80% of routine tasks, Opus 4 ($75/M) for critical decisions, and batch processing for 50% discounts. Enable 1-hour caching (90% savings on repeated contexts) and set thinking budgets based on task complexity: 4K for simple, 16K for complex, 32K for critical.",
      category: "optimization"
    },
    {
      question: "What are the most common implementation mistakes?",
      answer: "The top 3 mistakes are: Over-allocating thinking budgets beyond 32K tokens (solve by using logarithmic scaling), failing to preserve thinking blocks in conversations (prevent with preserveInHistory flag), and not enabling streaming for large responses (avoid by always using streaming for production). Each mistake teaches valuable lessons about resource optimization.",
      category: "troubleshooting"
    },
    {
      question: "How do production teams like GitHub and Cursor use this?",
      answer: "Production teams implement tiered architectures: GitHub Copilot uses selective thinking for complex suggestions, Cursor described it as 'state-of-the-art for coding' with dynamic budget allocation, and Replit reports 'higher success rates with more surgical edits.' They achieve 41% faster task completion by combining instant responses for simple queries with extended thinking for complex reasoning.",
