  If your MCP server isn't working, check these common issues:
</Callout>

<UnifiedContentBox contentType="infobox" title="Troubleshooting Checklist" variant="warning">
  - **Invalid JSON syntax**: Validate your claude_desktop_config.json with a JSON validator
  - **Incorrect file paths**: Always use absolute paths, not relative paths
  - **Missing dependencies**: Run `npm list -g` to verify all packages are installed
  - **Permission issues**: Ensure servers have read/write access to specified directories
  - **Port conflicts**: Check if another process is using the same port
  - **Outdated versions**: Update Claude Desktop and MCP servers regularly
