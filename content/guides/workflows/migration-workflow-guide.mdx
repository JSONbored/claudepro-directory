## Frequently Asked Questions

<AIOptimizedFAQ
  title="Migration Implementation Questions"
  description="Common questions about migrating from ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot to Claude"
  questions={[
    {
      question: "How long does it take to migrate from ChatGPT to Claude?",
      answer: "Migration timelines vary from 90-day pilots to 360-day enterprise deployments. TELUS completed full migration across 57,000 employees in 24 months. Typical phases: 90-day pilot with 5-15 users, 180-day expansion to departments, 360-day enterprise rollout. Technical integration using OpenAI SDK compatibility can be implemented in days.",
      category: "implementation"
    },
    {
      question: "What's the cost difference between Claude and ChatGPT?",
      answer: "Claude Opus 4 costs $15/$75 per million tokens versus GPT-4o's $3/$10, a 5-7.5x premium. However, performance-adjusted calculations show Claude's 72.5% success rate versus 54.6% makes the effective cost difference 5.6x. Batch processing provides 50% discounts, prompt caching delivers 90% reductions, bringing costs closer to parity for high-volume usage.",
      category: "costs"
    },
    {
      question: "How do I switch from OpenAI API to Claude?",
      answer: "Anthropic provides official OpenAI SDK compatibility enabling minimal code changes. Simply update the base_url to 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1/' and use your Anthropic API key. Existing OpenAI client code works unchanged. For optimal performance, implement XML-structured prompts and leverage Claude's million-token context window.",
      category: "technical"
    },
    {
      question: "What are Claude Opus 4 migration best practices?",
      answer: "Start with high-value use cases showing clear ROI like Bridgewater's 35x DCF speedup. Implement phased rollout: 5% pilot traffic, then 25%, 50%, 100%. Use XML tag prompting for 35% accuracy improvement. Deploy batch processing for 50% cost reduction. Build champion networks like NBIM's 40 ambassadors. Embed into existing tools rather than requiring new workflows.",
