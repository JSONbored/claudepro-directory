# Fix Claude Code Memory Leaks & Performance Issues

<TLDRSummary>
**Quick Fix:** Claude Code processes can consume 120GB RAM within 60 minutes. Clear context with `/clear` every 40 messages. Configure memory limits to 4096MB. Monitor RAM usage actively. Keep CLAUDE.md files under 5KB for optimal performance.
</TLDRSummary>

<InfoBox type="error" title="Critical Performance Issue">
Claude Code experiences severe memory leaks causing system crashes. RAM usage grows from 300MB to 120GB within one hour. This affects macOS, Linux, and WSL2 environments. Immediate action prevents complete system failure.
</InfoBox>

## Identifying the Problem

Claude Code memory issues manifest through predictable patterns. Your system shows clear warning signs before critical failure. RAM consumption starts at 300MB during initialization. Memory usage doubles every 10 minutes of active coding. The process eventually consumes all available system memory. Your machine becomes unresponsive requiring forced restart.

Performance degradation follows three distinct phases. Initial phase shows minor lag in command responses. Intermediate phase brings noticeable delays exceeding 5 seconds. Critical phase freezes all Claude operations completely. Each phase requires different intervention strategies.

## Context Window Optimization

Claude 4 provides a massive 1 million token context. This equals 750,000 words or 75,000 lines of code. Strategic management prevents performance degradation significantly. Poor context usage causes 60% of performance issues. Optimized workflows achieve 80% token reduction consistently.

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    {
      label: "/clear Command",
      content: (
        <div>
          <h4>Strategic /clear Usage</h4>
          
          <p>The /clear command removes conversation history instantly. It preserves current file context and settings. Use this between unrelated development tasks. Clear sessions every 40 messages for optimal performance. This prevents automatic compaction interrupting your workflow.</p>
          
          <CodeGroup
  title="bash"
  examples={[{
    language: "bash",
    
    code: `# Clear before starting new feature
/clear

# Clear with context preservation
/clear --preserve-files

# Clear and reload CLAUDE.md
/clear --reload-config`
  }]}
/>
          
          <p><strong>Result:</strong> 40-70% token savings per development session achieved consistently</p>

Configuration changes require Claude restart for activation. Adjust values based on your hardware capabilities. Monitor impact using built-in diagnostic tools. These settings prevent 85% of performance issues. Regular tuning maintains optimal operation continuously.

## Hardware Requirements

Optimal Claude Code performance demands specific hardware minimums. Systems need 16GB RAM for basic operations. Large projects require 32GB for smooth performance. Modern multi-core processors handle operations efficiently. SSD storage improves file operation speed significantly.

## Prevention Best Practices

Successful Claude Code usage requires systematic approaches. Implement daily maintenance routines preventing degradation. Monitor resource consumption throughout development sessions. Create project-specific optimization strategies proactively. These practices maintain 2-10x productivity gains.

Session management follows lifecycle patterns. Start with minimal essential context loading. Add specific files only when needed. Compact context before reaching 80% capacity. Save summaries before clearing for continuity.
