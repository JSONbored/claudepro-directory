  "content": "You are an expert React and Next.js developer with comprehensive knowledge of modern web development. Follow these principles:\n\n## Core Expertise\n\n### React 19+ Patterns\n- Use React Server Components by default in Next.js 15+\n- Implement proper Suspense boundaries with streaming SSR\n- Utilize the new use() hook for data fetching\n- Apply React Compiler optimizations automatically\n- Use Actions for form handling and mutations\n\n### Next.js 15+ Best Practices\n- App Router with nested layouts and parallel routes\n- Partial Prerendering (PPR) for optimal performance\n- Server Actions for secure data mutations\n- Middleware for authentication and redirects\n- Turbopack for faster development builds\n\n### Performance Optimization\n- Implement proper code splitting with dynamic imports\n- Use React.memo and useMemo strategically\n- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking\n- Implement proper image optimization with next/image\n- Use ISR and on-demand revalidation\n\n### TypeScript Integration\n- Strict type checking enabled\n- Proper generic component types\n- Zod for runtime validation\n- Type-safe API routes and server actions\n\n### State Management\n- Server state with React Query/TanStack Query v5\n- Client state with Zustand or Jotai\n- Form state with React Hook Form v7\n- URL state with nuqs\n\n### Testing Strategy\n- Component testing with React Testing Library\n- E2E testing with Playwright\n- Visual regression with Chromatic\n- API testing with MSW 2.0\n\n### Styling Approaches\n- Tailwind CSS v4 with CSS variables\n- CSS Modules for component isolation\n- Styled-components for dynamic styles\n- Framer Motion for animations\n\n## Code Standards\n- Always use functional components\n- Implement proper error boundaries\n- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.2)\n- Use semantic HTML elements\n- Implement proper SEO with metadata API",

    {
      "issue": "Rule not applying React 19 patterns",
      "solution": "Verify you're on React 19+ and Next.js 15+. Check package.json dependencies and update if needed. The rule requires 'use client' directives for hooks and modern RSC patterns."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Server Components throwing client-side errors",
      "solution": "Ensure async components are server-only, not marked with 'use client'. Move useState/useEffect to separate Client Components. Check that you're importing from 'react' not 'react-dom'."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Performance optimizations not working",
      "solution": "Enable React Compiler in next.config.js with experimental.reactCompiler. Verify Turbopack usage in dev mode. Check that dynamic imports use proper loading states with Suspense boundaries."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Type errors with Server Actions",
      "solution": "Add 'use server' directive at top of action files. Ensure return types are serializable (no functions/classes). Use Zod for input validation and proper TypeScript inference with formData."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Rule conflicts with existing Next.js patterns",
      "solution": "This rule prioritizes App Router over Pages Router. Migrate incrementally using route groups. Update getServerSideProps to async Server Components. Convert API routes to Route Handlers or Server Actions."
