      "issue": "Search API hitting rate limit with only few requests",
      "solution": "Search endpoints limited to 4 requests per second per token. Add 250ms delays between search operations. Consider caching search results to reduce API calls."
    },
    {
      "issue": "HTTP 401 unauthorized - OAuth token invalid",
      "solution": "Check access token expiration (look at expires_in parameter). Re-authenticate to get new OAuth token. Verify token has correct scopes for HubSpot API access (contacts, deals, etc)."
    },
    {
      "issue": "HTTP 403 forbidden when accessing CRM objects",
      "solution": "Verify OAuth token has required scopes. Contacts access needed for contacts, content access for deals. Check account permissions in HubSpot settings and re-authenticate with correct scopes."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Error rate exceeds 5% causing marketplace issues",
      "solution": "Reduce failed requests by implementing proper error handling. Validate input before API calls. Check API responses and fix 4xx errors in your code to lower error rate below 5%."
