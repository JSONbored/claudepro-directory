      "solution": "Production: https://connect.squareup.com/v2. Sandbox: https://connect.squareupsandbox.com/v2. Use correct access token for environment from Developer Console. Verify application ID matches environment. Check token not expired or revoked."

      "issue": "Sandbox limitations - payment method not supported",
      "solution": "Sandbox only supports credit/debit card payments. Afterpay, Cash App Pay, Google Pay, Apple Pay not available in Sandbox. Test payment flows in production with real cards after Sandbox validation."

      "solution": "Verify merchant account has active location enabled. Check access token has permissions for specific location ID. Ensure user role allows API operations. Review location settings in Square Dashboard."
