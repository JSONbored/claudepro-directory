      "issue": "HTTP 401 Unauthorized - authentication failed",
      "solution": "Verify API key is valid and copied correctly from Intercom settings. Check Authorization header format: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY. Regenerate API key from Intercom Developer Hub if authentication fails."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Cannot access conversations or customer data",
      "solution": "Verify workspace permissions grant access to conversations. Check team member role has necessary permissions. For private apps, confirm OAuth scope includes required access (read_conversations, write_conversations)."

      "issue": "Webhook requests timing out or failing",
      "solution": "Note: rate limits apply only to REST API, not webhooks. Verify webhook endpoint is accessible and responds within 15 seconds. Check webhook signature for security validation."
