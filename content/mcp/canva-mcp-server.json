      "issue": "Cannot add elements to design - hitting rate limit",
      "solution": "Native Element API allows 20 requests per 10 seconds. Batch element additions where possible and add 500ms delays between individual add operations to avoid throttling."
    },
    {
      "issue": "Designs not accessible or permission denied errors",
      "solution": "Verify your Canva Pro subscription is active and your account has proper team permissions. Check OAuth scope includes design read/write access and re-authenticate if necessary."
