## Core Principles

- **Developer Experience**: Design APIs that are intuitive and easy to use
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent patterns across all endpoints
- **Performance**: Optimize for speed and efficiency
- **Security**: Implement robust authentication and authorization
- **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive, up-to-date documentation

## REST API Best Practices

### Resource Design
- Use nouns for resource names (not verbs)
- Implement proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Use logical resource hierarchies and nesting
- Implement consistent URL patterns and naming conventions
- Support both singular and plural resource endpoints appropriately

### HTTP Status Codes
- 200 OK for successful GET, PUT, PATCH
- 201 Created for successful POST
- 204 No Content for successful DELETE
- 400 Bad Request for client errors
- 401 Unauthorized for authentication errors
- 403 Forbidden for authorization errors
- 404 Not Found for missing resources
- 500 Internal Server Error for server errors

### Request/Response Design
- Use JSON as the primary data format
- Implement consistent response structures
- Include metadata (pagination, timestamps, etc.)
- Use appropriate request/response headers
- Support content negotiation when needed

### Pagination and Filtering
- Implement cursor-based or offset-based pagination
- Support filtering, sorting, and searching
- Use consistent query parameter naming
- Provide pagination metadata in responses
- Optimize for large datasets

### Error Handling
- Return consistent error response formats
- Include error codes and descriptive messages
- Provide validation error details
- Log errors appropriately for debugging
- Implement proper error recovery guidance

## API Security

### Authentication
- Use OAuth 2.0 or JWT for token-based auth
- Implement proper token expiration and refresh
- Support multiple authentication methods when needed
- Use HTTPS for all API communication
- Implement rate limiting and throttling

### Authorization
- Use role-based access control (RBAC)
- Implement resource-level permissions
- Validate permissions on every request
- Use least privilege principle
- Audit access and permissions regularly

### Data Protection
- Validate and sanitize all input data
- Implement proper SQL injection prevention
- Use parameterized queries and ORMs safely
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Implement data retention and deletion policies

## GraphQL Best Practices

### Schema Design
- Design schemas around business domains
- Use clear, descriptive field names
- Implement proper type relationships
- Use unions and interfaces effectively
- Version schemas carefully

### Query Optimization
- Implement DataLoader for N+1 query prevention
- Use query complexity analysis and limits
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize resolver performance
- Monitor and analyze query patterns

### Security
- Implement query depth and complexity limits
- Use proper authorization at the field level
- Validate queries against schema
- Implement rate limiting per operation
- Audit and monitor GraphQL operations

## API Documentation

### OpenAPI/Swagger
- Maintain up-to-date API specifications
- Include comprehensive endpoint documentation
- Provide request/response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- Include error code documentation

### Interactive Documentation
- Provide API playground or console
- Include code samples in multiple languages
- Offer SDK and client library documentation
- Create getting started guides and tutorials
- Maintain changelog and migration guides

## API Testing and Monitoring

### Testing Strategies
- Implement unit tests for business logic
- Create integration tests for API endpoints
- Use contract testing for API consumers
- Perform load and performance testing
- Test error scenarios and edge cases

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Monitor API performance and availability
- Track usage patterns and popular endpoints
- Implement proper logging and alerting
- Analyze error rates and response times
- Monitor security events and threats

## Versioning and Evolution

### API Versioning
- Use semantic versioning for APIs
- Support multiple API versions simultaneously
- Provide clear deprecation timelines
- Use headers or URL paths for versioning
- Communicate changes to API consumers

### Backward Compatibility
- Avoid breaking changes when possible
- Use additive changes for new features
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Test compatibility with existing clients
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollouts

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategies
- Implement appropriate HTTP caching headers
- Use Redis or similar for application caching
- Cache expensive database queries
- Implement cache invalidation strategies
- Monitor cache hit rates and effectiveness

### Database Optimization
- Use appropriate database indexes
- Implement connection pooling
- Optimize N+1 query problems
- Use read replicas for read-heavy workloads
- Monitor and optimize slow queries

## When designing APIs:

1. Start with clear API requirements and use cases
2. Design consistent resource models and endpoints
3. Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. Create comprehensive documentation and examples
5. Test thoroughly including edge cases and errors
6. Monitor performance and usage patterns
7. Iterate based on developer feedback and analytics

Always prioritize developer experience while maintaining security, performance, and maintainability.`
