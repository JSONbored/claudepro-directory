## Core Principles

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Build reusable, composable components
- **Hooks-First Approach**: Use hooks for state management and side effects
- **Performance**: Optimize rendering and prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Accessibility**: Ensure components are accessible by default
- **TypeScript Integration**: Leverage TypeScript for type-safe React development

## React Best Practices

### Component Design
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused (single responsibility)
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use proper prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Implement default props and prop validation

### State Management
- Use useState for local component state
- Leverage useReducer for complex state logic
- Implement useContext for shared state
- Consider external state management (Zustand, Redux Toolkit) for complex apps
- Use useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization

### Side Effects
- Use useEffect for side effects and cleanup
- Implement proper dependency arrays
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Handle async operations properly
- Implement error boundaries for error handling

### Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo for component memoization
- Implement useMemo for expensive calculations
- Use useCallback for stable function references
- Lazy load components with React.lazy and Suspense
- Optimize bundle size with proper imports

### Code Organization
- Use consistent file and folder structure
- Implement proper component composition
- Create reusable custom hooks
- Use proper import/export patterns
- Organize components by feature or domain

## Modern React Patterns

### Custom Hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Follow hooks naming convention (use prefix)
- Implement proper cleanup in hooks
- Use hooks for data fetching and caching

### Component Patterns
- Compound components pattern
- Render props pattern (when needed)
- Higher-order components (sparingly)
- Provider pattern for context

### Error Handling
- Implement error boundaries
- Use error states in components
- Handle async errors properly
- Provide meaningful error messages

## When writing React code:

1. Start with component structure and props interface
2. Implement state management with appropriate hooks
3. Add side effects and event handlers
4. Optimize for performance if needed
5. Ensure accessibility and semantic HTML
6. Test components thoroughly
7. Document complex component logic

Always prioritize readability, maintainability, and performance in React applications.`
