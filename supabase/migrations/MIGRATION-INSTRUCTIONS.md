**Status**: ✅ Production-ready (safe for live database)

---

## 🛡️ Safety Guarantees

This migration is **100% safe** to run on your live database:

✅ **No data loss** - Only creates new tables, doesn't modify existing ones
✅ **Idempotent** - Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` - safe to run multiple times
✅ **Non-destructive** - No DROP statements except for trigger recreation
✅ **No downtime** - Creates new tables without locking existing ones
✅ **Rollback-safe** - Can be reversed without affecting existing data

## 📋 What This Migration Adds

### 1. Featured Configs System
- **Table**: `featured_configs` - Weekly algorithm-selected featured content
- **Indexes**: 4 performance indexes for weekly queries
- **RLS Policies**: Public read, service role write
- **Use Case**: Homepage featured sections, trending page

### 2. Reviews & Ratings System
- **Table**: `review_ratings` - User reviews with star ratings (1-5)
- **Table**: `review_helpful_votes` - Track helpful votes on reviews
- **Indexes**: 6 performance indexes for review display and aggregation
- **RLS Policies**: Public read, authenticated write (own reviews only)
- **Triggers**:
  - Auto-update `helpful_count` when votes change
  - Award reputation points for helpful reviews (+5 at 5 votes, +10 at 10 votes)
  - Auto-update `updated_at` timestamp on review edits

## 🚀 How to Run (Supabase SQL Editor)

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor
1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**

### Step 2: Copy Migration Script
1. Open `supabase/migrations/migration-2025-10-10-reviews-and-featured.sql`
2. Copy the **entire contents** of the file
3. Paste into the SQL Editor

### Step 3: Run Migration
1. Click **Run** button (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
2. Wait for completion (should take < 5 seconds)
3. Check for success message

### Step 4: Verify Migration
Run these verification queries:

```sql
-- Check tables were created
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('featured_configs', 'review_ratings', 'review_helpful_votes')
ORDER BY tablename;

-- Expected output: 3 rows (all 3 tables)

-- Check indexes were created
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND indexname LIKE 'idx_featured_configs%'
   OR indexname LIKE 'idx_review%'
ORDER BY indexname;

-- Expected output: 10 indexes

-- Check RLS is enabled
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
  AND tablename IN ('featured_configs', 'review_ratings', 'review_helpful_votes');

-- Expected output: All should show rowsecurity = true

-- Check triggers were created
SELECT tgname FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgname LIKE '%review%'
ORDER BY tgname;

-- Expected output: 3 triggers
```

---

## 🧪 Post-Migration Testing

### Test 1: Insert Test Review (as authenticated user)
```sql
-- Run this as an authenticated user via Supabase client, NOT in SQL editor
-- This is just for reference - DO NOT run in SQL editor

INSERT INTO public.review_ratings (user_id, content_type, content_slug, rating, review_text)
VALUES ('your-user-id', 'agents', 'test-agent', 5, 'Great agent!');
```

### Test 2: Query Featured Configs (empty initially)
```sql
SELECT * FROM public.featured_configs
ORDER BY week_start DESC, rank ASC;

-- Expected: Empty result (will be populated by weekly cron job)
```

### Test 3: Check Permissions
```sql
-- This should work (public read)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.review_ratings;

-- This should work (public read)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.featured_configs;
```

## 🔄 Rollback Instructions (if needed)

⚠️ **Only run this if you need to completely remove the new features**

```sql
-- WARNING: This will delete all reviews and featured configs data
-- Only run if you're sure you want to rollback

-- Drop triggers
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_update_helpful_count_on_insert ON public.review_helpful_votes;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_update_helpful_count_on_delete ON public.review_helpful_votes;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS trigger_reputation_on_helpful_review ON public.review_ratings;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_review_ratings_updated_at ON public.review_ratings;

-- Drop functions
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.update_review_helpful_count();
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.update_reputation_on_helpful_review();

-- Drop tables (cascades to indexes and policies)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.review_helpful_votes CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.review_ratings CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS public.featured_configs CASCADE;
```

## 📊 Database Impact Analysis

### Estimated Storage Impact
- **featured_configs**: ~1KB per featured item × 70 items/week = ~70KB/week
- **review_ratings**: ~500 bytes per review (varies with review text length)
- **review_helpful_votes**: ~100 bytes per vote
- **Total estimated monthly growth**: < 500KB

### Performance Impact
- ✅ **Minimal** - All tables have proper indexes
- ✅ **No impact on existing queries** - New tables are separate
- ✅ **Fast inserts** - Triggers are optimized
- ✅ **Efficient reads** - Covering indexes for common queries

### Query Performance Estimates
- Fetch featured configs for current week: **< 5ms**
- Fetch reviews for a config: **< 10ms**
- Insert new review: **< 20ms** (includes trigger execution)
- Check if user voted review helpful: **< 5ms** (covered by unique index)

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Error: "function update_updated_at_column() does not exist"
**Solution**: The migration assumes `update_updated_at_column()` function exists from the main schema. If you get this error, add this before running the migration:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;
```

### Error: "relation already exists"
**Solution**: This is normal if you've already run the migration. The `IF NOT EXISTS` clauses prevent errors, but you'll see notices. Safe to ignore.

### Error: "permission denied"
**Solution**: Make sure you're running the migration with a role that has `CREATE TABLE` permissions (service_role or postgres role).
