# - DATE_CONFIG.claudeModels.sonnet (e.g., "Claude Sonnet 4.5")
# - DATE_CONFIG.claudeModels.opus (e.g., "Claude Opus 4.1")
# NEVER hardcode dates or model versions - always reference these constants!
#

{/* INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE DESKTOP:
MetricsDisplay creates visual KPI cards with colored trend badges. Use for:
- Performance metrics (speed, accuracy, throughput, latency)
- Cost comparisons (monthly cost, TCO, cost per request)
- Usage statistics (adoption rate, user satisfaction, uptime)
- Quality metrics (error rate, success rate, resolution time)

Each metric configuration:
- label: Metric name (keep concise, max 3-4 words)
- value: The actual measurement with unit (e.g., "2.3s", "$450/mo", "94%")
- change: Comparison or context text (e.g., "45% faster", "+$50 vs competitor")
- trend: Visual indicator - "up" (green/positive), "down" (red/negative), "neutral" (gray), "+" (green badge)

Best practices:
- Group related metrics (all speed metrics together, then accuracy, then cost)
- Use consistent units within each category
- Always include comparison context in 'change' field
- Limit to 6-9 metrics maximum for visual clarity
- Use REAL benchmark data, not estimates
- Consider using multiple MetricsDisplay components for different metric categories
