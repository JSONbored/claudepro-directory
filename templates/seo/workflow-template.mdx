{/* INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE DESKTOP:
MetricsDisplay for workflows should focus on:
- Time/efficiency metrics (hours saved, tasks completed faster)
- Quality improvements (error rates, accuracy, compliance)
- Financial impact (cost savings, revenue increases, ROI)
- User/team metrics (satisfaction, adoption rate, productivity)
- Process metrics (throughput, cycle time, bottleneck reduction)

Best practices for workflow metrics:
- Use before/after comparisons in the 'change' field
- Include time periods for context (per week, per month)
- Show both absolute values and percentage improvements
- Focus on business impact metrics that matter to stakeholders
- Use real data from actual workflow implementations
