# Out of Scope
# The following are considered out of scope for vulnerability reports:
# - Issues in third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
# - Social engineering attacks
# - Physical attacks
# - Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
# - Rate limit bypasses that don't lead to data exposure
# - Issues requiring unlikely user interaction
# - Issues in deprecated features
# - Self-XSS

# In Scope
# We particularly appreciate reports for:
# - Authentication/authorization bypass
# - SQL injection, NoSQL injection
# - Remote code execution (RCE)
# - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
# - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
# - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
# - Sensitive data exposure
# - Security misconfigurations
# - Insecure direct object references (IDOR)

# Response Time
# - Initial response: Within 48 hours
# - Status update: Within 7 days
# - Resolution target: Within 90 days (severity-dependent)

# Safe Harbor
# We support responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against
# security researchers who:
# - Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations
# - Do not exploit vulnerabilities beyond what is necessary to demonstrate them
# - Report vulnerabilities privately to us first
# - Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
