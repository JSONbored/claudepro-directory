# Supabase Realtime Database Builder Skill

## What This Skill Enables

Claude can build complete backend systems using Supabase, the open-source Firebase alternative that raised $100M at $5B valuation in October 2025. With 4M+ developers and enterprise-scale Multigres features launching, Supabase provides PostgreSQL database, real-time subscriptions, authentication, storage, and Edge Functions - all with automatic APIs and pgvector for AI embeddings.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Claude Pro subscription or Claude Code CLI
- Supabase account (free tier available)
- Node.js 18+ for client libraries
- Basic SQL and JavaScript knowledge

**What Claude handles automatically:**
- Setting up Supabase project and database schema
- Creating Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Generating TypeScript types from database
- Implementing real-time subscriptions
- Configuring authentication with multiple providers
- Building Edge Functions with Deno
- Setting up Storage buckets with access control
- Integrating pgvector for AI embeddings

## How to Use This Skill

### Initialize Supabase Project

**Prompt:** "Set up a Supabase project for a task management app with users, projects, tasks tables. Include RLS policies and TypeScript types."

Claude will:
1. Create database schema with foreign keys
2. Set up RLS policies for multi-tenant data
3. Generate migration files
4. Create TypeScript types with supabase gen types
5. Initialize Supabase client in application
6. Add authentication flow
7. Configure authorization rules

### Real-Time Collaboration

**Prompt:** "Build real-time chat functionality where users see messages instantly when posted. Include typing indicators and online presence."

Claude will:
1. Create messages table with indexes
2. Set up real-time subscription channel
3. Implement message broadcasting
4. Add presence tracking
5. Show typing indicator
6. Handle connection state
7. Optimize with message batching

### AI Integration with pgvector

**Prompt:** "Create a semantic search system using pgvector. Store document embeddings from OpenAI and enable similarity search with cosine distance."

Claude will:
1. Enable pgvector extension
2. Create table with vector column
3. Generate embeddings with OpenAI
4. Store vectors in Supabase
5. Implement similarity search RPC
6. Add HNSW index for performance
7. Create semantic search API

### Edge Functions for Business Logic

**Prompt:** "Build Edge Functions that: send welcome emails on signup, process webhook from Stripe, and run nightly data aggregation job."

Claude will:
1. Create Deno Edge Functions
2. Set up function triggers (database, HTTP, cron)
3. Implement email sending with Resend
4. Add Stripe webhook validation
5. Create scheduled job
6. Include error handling and logging
7. Deploy with supabase functions deploy

## Tips for Best Results

1. **RLS is Critical**: Always implement Row Level Security policies. Request policies that match your access patterns (user owns data, team members can access, public read).

2. **Type Generation**: Use `supabase gen types typescript` to generate TypeScript types. This ensures client code matches database schema.

3. **Real-Time Channels**: Supabase real-time has different channel types (postgres_changes, broadcast, presence). Specify which you need based on use case.

4. **Edge Functions with Deno**: Supabase uses Deno for Edge Functions. Request Deno-compatible code (no Node.js-specific APIs).

5. **Storage Access Control**: Storage buckets can be public or private. Request appropriate RLS policies for file access.

6. **Connection Pooling**: For serverless deployments, use Supabase connection pooling to avoid exceeding connection limits.

## Common Workflows
