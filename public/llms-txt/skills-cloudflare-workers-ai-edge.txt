# Cloudflare Workers AI Edge Functions Skill

## What This Skill Enables

Claude can build and deploy AI-powered serverless functions on Cloudflare's global edge network, spanning 275+ cities with sub-5ms cold start times (10-80x faster than AWS Lambda@Edge). With 40% edge computing market share and 4,000% year-over-year growth in AI inference requests, Cloudflare Workers AI brings machine learning models directly to users worldwide with minimal latency.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Claude Pro subscription or Claude Code CLI
- Cloudflare account (free tier available)
- Wrangler CLI installed (`npm install -g wrangler`)
- Basic understanding of JavaScript/TypeScript

**What Claude handles automatically:**
- Writing Workers code with TypeScript types
- Configuring wrangler.toml for deployments
- Implementing AI model bindings (Llama-2, Whisper, Stable Diffusion)
- Setting up D1 database and R2 storage integrations
- Managing environment variables and secrets
- Deploying to Cloudflare's edge network
- Optimizing for V8 isolate performance

## How to Use This Skill

### Deploy a Basic Edge Function

**Prompt:** "Create a Cloudflare Worker that responds to HTTP requests with JSON data and deploys to the edge."

Claude will:
1. Generate a Worker with proper `fetch` event handler
2. Create `wrangler.toml` configuration
3. Set up TypeScript types for Request/Response
4. Add error handling and CORS headers
5. Deploy with `wrangler publish`
6. Provide the deployed Worker URL

### AI Model Integration (Llama-2 Chat)

**Prompt:** "Build a Cloudflare Worker that uses Llama-2 to generate chat responses. Accept POST requests with user messages and stream the AI responses back."

Claude will:
1. Configure AI binding in wrangler.toml
2. Implement streaming response with ReadableStream
3. Add proper prompt formatting for Llama-2
4. Set up rate limiting to control costs
5. Include request validation and error handling
6. Deploy with Workers AI binding enabled

### Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

**Prompt:** "Create an edge function that generates images using Stable Diffusion XL. Accept a text prompt via API and return the generated image URL stored in R2."

Claude will:
1. Set up Workers AI binding for Stable Diffusion
2. Configure R2 bucket for image storage
3. Implement image generation with proper parameters
4. Upload generated images to R2 with public URLs
5. Add caching headers for CDN optimization
6. Include usage analytics with D1 database

### Real-Time Translation API

**Prompt:** "Build a translation API using Cloudflare Workers AI that detects the source language and translates to the target language. Support 50+ languages with edge caching."

Claude will:
1. Use Workers AI translation models
2. Implement language detection
3. Set up KV namespace for translation caching
4. Add rate limiting per IP address
5. Configure CDN cache for common translations
6. Include usage metrics and error logging

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Leverage V8 Isolates**: Workers use V8 isolates that start in <5ms and use 1/10th the memory of Node.js. Design stateless functions that take advantage of this architecture.

2. **Use Durable Objects for State**: For stateful operations (WebSockets, real-time collaboration), request Durable Objects implementation instead of external databases.

3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate AI models based on latency requirements. Smaller models like Llama-2-7B offer faster inference than larger variants.

4. **Edge Caching**: Implement Cache API or KV storage for frequently accessed data to reduce AI inference costs.

5. **Cost Optimization**: Workers AI charges per request. Use caching, rate limiting, and request batching to optimize costs.

6. **Geographic Routing**: Workers automatically route to the nearest data center. For AI models, consider pinning specific regions for data residency compliance.

## Common Workflows

### Full-Stack AI Application
```
"Create a complete AI-powered application on Cloudflare:
1. Workers AI for text generation (Llama-2)
2. D1 database for storing conversations
3. R2 for file uploads and generated content
4. KV for session management and caching
5. Pages for frontend deployment
6. Queue for background job processing
Include TypeScript types and deployment scripts."
```

### Content Moderation API
```
"Build an edge API that:
1. Accepts text content via POST request
2. Uses Workers AI to detect harmful content
3. Classifies content as safe/unsafe with confidence scores
4. Logs results to D1 database
5. Returns moderation decision in <100ms
6. Handles 10,000 requests per minute"
```

### Smart Image CDN
```
"Create a Cloudflare Worker that:
1. Intercepts image requests
2. Analyzes image with Workers AI (OCR, object detection)
3. Automatically optimizes images for device/bandwidth
4. Stores optimized versions in R2
5. Serves from edge cache on subsequent requests
6. Includes usage analytics and cost tracking"
```
