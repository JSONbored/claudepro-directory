# V0 Rapid UI Prototyping Workflow Skill

## What This Skill Enables

Claude can generate production-ready React components and complete page layouts using V0.dev patterns - Vercel's breakthrough AI UI generator that has transformed frontend development in 2025. This skill enables instant component creation with shadcn/ui integration, TailwindCSS v4 styling, full TypeScript support, and seamless Next.js 15 App Router compatibility.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Next.js 15+ project (App Router)
- TailwindCSS v4.1+ configured
- shadcn/ui components installed
- Node.js 18+

**What Claude handles automatically:**
- Generating React 19 components with proper TypeScript types
- Applying TailwindCSS v4 styling with CSS variables
- Integrating shadcn/ui components
- Creating responsive, mobile-first layouts
- Adding framer-motion animations
- Implementing accessibility (WCAG 2.2 Level AA)
- Server/Client component distinction

## How to Use This Skill

### Component Generation from Description

**Prompt:** "Create a pricing table component with 3 tiers (Basic, Pro, Enterprise). Include monthly/annual toggle, feature lists with checkmarks, and prominent CTA buttons. Use shadcn/ui Card and Button components."

Claude will:
1. Generate TypeScript component with proper types
2. Use shadcn/ui primitives (Card, Button, Switch)
3. Apply TailwindCSS v4 utility classes
4. Implement state management with useState
5. Add responsive grid layout
6. Include accessibility attributes (ARIA labels)
7. Add smooth transitions with CSS

### Dashboard Layout Creation

**Prompt:** "Build an analytics dashboard layout with sidebar navigation, header with search and notifications, stat cards showing KPIs, revenue chart using Recharts, and recent activity table. Make it fully responsive."

Claude will:
1. Create Server Component for static shell
2. Add Client Components for interactive elements
3. Implement responsive sidebar (mobile drawer)
4. Generate stat cards with icons from lucide-react
5. Integrate Recharts with proper TypeScript types
6. Add loading states with Suspense boundaries
7. Include dark mode support via next-themes

### Form Generation with Validation

**Prompt:** "Create a user registration form with email, password, confirm password, and terms acceptance. Use react-hook-form with Zod validation. Show validation errors inline and disable submit until valid."

Claude will:
1. Generate form with shadcn/ui Form components
2. Define Zod schema with comprehensive validation
3. Integrate react-hook-form with zodResolver
4. Add password strength indicator
5. Implement real-time validation feedback
6. Create accessible error messages
7. Add loading state during submission

### Landing Page Section

**Prompt:** "Design a hero section with gradient background, animated headline text, two CTA buttons, and three feature highlights below. Include subtle animations on scroll using framer-motion."

Claude will:
1. Create responsive hero layout
2. Add gradient backgrounds with TailwindCSS
3. Implement text animations with framer-motion
4. Add button hover effects
5. Create feature cards with icons
6. Implement scroll-triggered animations
7. Optimize for Core Web Vitals

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific About Components**: Mention exact shadcn/ui components you want (Card, Button, Dialog, etc.) for consistent design system usage.

2. **Request Mobile-First**: Always specify "mobile-first responsive design" to ensure proper breakpoints and touch-friendly interactions.

3. **Accessibility First**: Ask for WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance to get proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.

4. **Server vs Client**: Clarify if components need interactivity (Client Component with 'use client') or can be static (Server Component).

5. **Animation Budgets**: Request "performant animations" to get GPU-accelerated framer-motion transitions instead of heavy JavaScript.

6. **Dark Mode**: Specify "with dark mode support" to get proper color variable usage compatible with next-themes.

5. Related products carousel
6. Mobile-responsive layout with good UX
7. Loading states and error handling"
```

2. CustomCard with header, content, footer slots
3. CustomInput with label, error message, help text
4. CustomSelect with search and multi-select
5. All components with TypeScript props, accessibility, and Storybook-ready"
```
