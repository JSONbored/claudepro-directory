# Windsurf AI-Native Collaborative Development Skill

## What This Skill Enables

Claude can guide you through Windsurf's AI-native development environment, featuring Cascade AI for context-aware multi-file operations, Flow collaboration patterns for team coordination, and intelligent code navigation. Windsurf is emerging as a powerful alternative to GitHub Copilot in 2025, with superior multi-file refactoring and real-time collaboration features.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Windsurf IDE installed (download from codeium.com/windsurf)
- Active project/codebase
- Basic understanding of your tech stack

**What Claude helps you master:**
- Cascade AI prompts for multi-file operations
- Flow sessions for team collaboration
- Context-aware code navigation
- Intelligent refactoring workflows
- AI-assisted debugging patterns
- Code review with Cascade

## How to Use This Skill

### Multi-File Refactoring with Cascade

**Prompt:** "I need to refactor our authentication system from NextAuth to better-auth v1.3.9. Walk me through using Cascade AI to update all files while maintaining existing functionality."

Claude will guide you to:
1. Select all auth-related files in Windsurf sidebar (Cmd/Ctrl+Click)
2. Open Cascade panel (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
3. Use specific Cascade prompt:
   ```
   Refactor authentication across these files to use better-auth v1.3.9:
   - Update lib/auth.ts to use betterAuth() instead of NextAuth()
   - Migrate session handling to better-auth patterns
   - Update all import statements
   - Maintain existing OAuth providers
   - Keep current session management logic
   ```
4. Review Cascade's proposed changes before applying
5. Test authentication flow after refactoring

### Flow Collaboration for Feature Development

**Prompt:** "Show me how to use Windsurf Flow to coordinate with my team on building a real-time notification system."

Claude will explain:
1. Create Flow session (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+F)
2. Define feature scope with Cascade:
   ```
   Implement real-time notifications using Supabase Realtime:
   - Database schema: notifications table with RLS
   - Server-side: Supabase client setup
   - Hooks: useNotifications with real-time subscription
   - UI: NotificationBell component
   - Follow patterns in /lib/supabase and /components/ui
   ```
3. Cascade generates coordinated changes across multiple files
4. Team members can review and collaborate in Flow session
5. Apply changes with atomic commits

### Context-Aware Code Navigation

**Prompt:** "Help me use Cascade to understand how error handling works across our codebase."

Claude will demonstrate:
1. Select a complex error handling function
2. Right-click â†’ Ask Cascade
3. Use prompt:
   ```
   Explain this error handling pattern and show me:
   1. Where else this pattern is used
   2. All files that import this error handler
   3. How errors propagate to the UI layer
   4. Any inconsistencies in error handling
   ```
4. Cascade provides context-aware analysis with file references
5. Navigate to related code using Cascade's suggestions

### Component Extraction with Cascade

**Prompt:** "Use Cascade to extract a reusable UserProfile component from my dashboard page."

Claude will guide:
1. Select the user profile section in dashboard/page.tsx
2. Open Cascade (Cmd/Ctrl+K)
3. Use extraction prompt:
   ```
   Extract user profile section into reusable component:
   - Create components/user/profile.tsx
   - Add TypeScript props interface
   - Support 'compact' and 'full' variants
   - Move styles to component
   - Update dashboard to import and use new component
   ```
4. Review Cascade's component design
5. Apply changes atomically

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Specific File Context**: When using Cascade, select all related files first (Cmd/Ctrl+Click in sidebar) to provide complete context for multi-file operations.

2. **Structured Prompts**: Format Cascade prompts with numbered steps or bullet points for complex refactorings to get organized, sequential changes.

3. **Reference Existing Patterns**: In prompts, reference specific files or patterns ("Follow patterns in /lib/api") to ensure consistency.

4. **Atomic Operations**: Use Flow sessions for coordinated multi-file changes to maintain codebase integrity.

5. **Verify Before Apply**: Always review Cascade's proposed changes before applying, especially for critical security or authentication code.

6. **Leverage Type Awareness**: Windsurf's deep TypeScript integration helps Cascade understand type dependencies across files - mention "maintain type safety" in prompts.

## Common Workflows

### Complete Feature Implementation
```
"Use Cascade Flow to implement user profile editing:
1. Database: Add Prisma schema for user profiles
2. API: Create tRPC mutations for profile updates
3. Validation: Define Zod schemas
4. UI: Build profile edit form with react-hook-form
5. State: Add optimistic updates
6. Follow our existing patterns in /lib and /components"
```
