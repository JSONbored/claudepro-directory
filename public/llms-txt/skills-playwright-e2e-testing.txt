# Playwright E2E Testing Automation Skill

## What This Skill Enables

Claude can write, execute, and maintain end-to-end tests using Playwright, the modern browser automation framework that has overtaken Cypress in npm downloads as of 2025. This skill enables cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari/WebKit), AI-powered test generation with GitHub Copilot integration, and official MCP (Model Context Protocol) support for structured DOM interactions.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Claude Pro subscription or Claude Code CLI
- Node.js 18+ installed
- Basic understanding of your application's user flows

**What Claude handles automatically:**
- Installing Playwright and browser binaries
- Generating test files with proper TypeScript types
- Setting up test configurations and reporters
- Writing selectors using accessibility snapshots
- Debugging test failures with traces and screenshots
- Optimizing tests for parallel execution

## How to Use This Skill

### Basic Test Generation

**Prompt:** "Create a Playwright test that logs into my application at localhost:3000, navigates to /dashboard, and verifies the welcome message appears."

Claude will:
1. Install Playwright if not present (`npm init playwright@latest`)
2. Generate a test file with proper page object patterns
3. Use accessibility-first selectors (role, label, text)
4. Include assertions with auto-retry logic
5. Add screenshot capture on failure

### AI-Powered Test Creation from User Stories

**Prompt:** "I have a checkout flow: user adds product to cart, enters shipping info, selects payment method, and completes order. Write comprehensive Playwright tests covering happy path and error cases."

Claude will:
1. Break down the user story into discrete test scenarios
2. Generate test files organized by feature
3. Include data-driven tests with fixtures
4. Add network mocking for payment gateway
5. Implement custom assertions for order confirmation
6. Set up test retry logic for flaky network calls

### Cross-Browser Testing Suite

**Prompt:** "Set up Playwright to test my application across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with parallel execution. Include mobile viewport testing for iOS and Android."

Claude will:
1. Configure `playwright.config.ts` with multiple projects
2. Define desktop and mobile browser contexts
3. Set up parallel worker configuration
4. Configure test sharding for CI/CD
5. Add HTML reporter with trace viewer
6. Include screenshot comparison for visual regression

### API Testing Integration

**Prompt:** "Write Playwright tests that verify my REST API endpoints before running UI tests. Mock the API responses for offline testing."

Claude will:
1. Use Playwright's `request` context for API calls
2. Create API test fixtures for reusable setup
3. Implement request/response interception
4. Generate mock data with realistic values
5. Set up contract testing with schema validation
6. Add performance timing assertions

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use Accessibility Selectors**: Playwright's MCP support leverages accessibility snapshots. Ask Claude to use `getByRole()`, `getByLabel()`, and `getByText()` instead of CSS selectors for more resilient tests.

2. **Parallel Execution**: Playwright's native parallelism is a key advantage. Request test organization that maximizes parallel worker usage with proper test isolation.

3. **Auto-Wait Smart Defaults**: Playwright automatically waits for elements to be actionable. Avoid explicit waits unless dealing with specific timing requirements.

4. **Trace on Failure**: Enable trace recording for CI environments to debug failures without reproducing locally: `--trace on-first-retry`.

5. **Codegen for Complex Flows**: For intricate user interactions, ask Claude to generate tests using `npx playwright codegen` output as a starting point.

6. **Test Sharding**: For large test suites in CI, request sharding configuration: `--shard=1/4` to split tests across multiple jobs.

## Common Workflows

### Complete E2E Test Suite Setup
```
"Set up a production-ready Playwright test suite for my Next.js app with:
1. Authentication flow tests with session storage
2. Visual regression testing with screenshot comparison
3. API mocking for external services
4. CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
5. HTML report with trace viewer
6. Parallel execution across 4 workers"
```

### AI-Assisted Test Maintenance
```
"My application's login form changed from using email to username.
Update all Playwright tests that interact with the login form,
using accessibility selectors instead of data-testid attributes."
```

### Performance Testing
```
"Write Playwright tests that measure:
1. First Contentful Paint (FCP)
2. Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
3. Time to Interactive (TTI)
4. Total Blocking Time (TBT)
Fail tests if any metric exceeds Web Vitals thresholds."
```

### Mobile-First Testing
```
"Create Playwright tests for mobile web experience:
1. Test on iPhone 13 and Pixel 5 viewports
2. Verify touch interactions (swi...
