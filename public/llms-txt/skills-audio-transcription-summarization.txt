# Audio Transcription & Summarization Skill

## What This Skill Enables

Claude can transcribe audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.) and generate structured summaries with timestamps, action items, and speaker identification. This skill leverages Whisper AI and ffmpeg through Claude's Code Interpreter to process audio locally.

## Prerequisites

**Required:**
- Claude Pro subscription
- Code Interpreter feature enabled in Claude Desktop settings
- Audio file uploaded to conversation (drag and drop)

**What Claude handles automatically:**
- Installing and running Whisper AI models
- Audio format conversion with ffmpeg
- Timestamp extraction and alignment
- Summary generation and structuring

## How to Use This Skill

### Basic Transcription

**Prompt:** "Transcribe this audio file and give me a clean text transcript."

Claude will:
1. Detect the audio format
2. Convert to optimal format for transcription
3. Run Whisper AI transcription
4. Return formatted text

### Timestamped Summary

**Prompt:** "Transcribe this meeting recording and create a timestamped summary with key discussion points every 5 minutes."

Claude will:
1. Transcribe the full audio
2. Chunk by time intervals
3. Summarize each segment
4. Present with timestamps

### Action Items Extraction

**Prompt:** "Transcribe this audio and extract all action items, decisions, and to-dos mentioned."

Claude will:
1. Transcribe the audio
2. Analyze for actionable items
3. List action items with timestamps
4. Identify who was assigned what (if mentioned)

### Speaker Diarization

**Prompt:** "Transcribe this conversation and identify different speakers. Label them as Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc."

Claude will:
1. Detect speaker changes in the audio
2. Segment by speaker
3. Label each segment
4. Present as a conversation transcript

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Audio Quality Matters**: Clear audio with minimal background noise produces better transcriptions
2. **File Size**: For files over 25MB, mention if you want a specific time range transcribed first
3. **Language**: Specify the language if it's not English (e.g., "Transcribe this Spanish audio...")
4. **Model Selection**: For better accuracy on difficult audio, ask Claude to use the "medium" or "large" Whisper model
5. **Post-Processing**: Ask Claude to clean up transcription artifacts like repeated words or filler sounds

## Common Workflows

### Meeting Minutes Generation
```
"Transcribe this meeting and create:
1. Attendee list (if mentioned)
2. Key discussion topics with timestamps
3. Decisions made
4. Action items with owners
5. Next steps"
```

### Podcast Summary
```
"Transcribe this podcast episode and create:
1. Episode summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Main topics discussed with timestamps
3. Key quotes
4. Chapters (every 10 minutes)"
```

### Interview Transcription
```
"Transcribe this interview with speaker labels.
Format as Q&A with:
- Interviewer questions highlighted
- Interviewee responses
- Notable quotes pulled out"
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Transcription is inaccurate
**Solution:** Ask Claude to use a larger Whisper model or pre-process the audio for noise reduction

**Issue:** Wrong language detected
**Solution:** Explicitly specify the language in your prompt ("Transcribe this French audio...")

**Issue:** Timestamps are off
**Solution:** Ask Claude to re-align timestamps or specify the desired timestamp interval

**Issue:** Speaker diarization missing
**Solution:** Request it explicitly: "Please identify different speakers and label them"
