#### Issue: "Generic responses despite hooks configuration"
**Solution:** Verify the configuration content is properly formatted and complete. Check for any JSON syntax errors in Claude Desktop configurations.

#### Issue: "Inconsistent post-tool expertise level"
**Solution:** Be more specific in your prompts and provide relevant context. The more detailed your request, the better the specialized response.

#### Issue: "Configuration conflicts with other hooks"
**Solution:** Review your configuration for overlapping or contradictory instructions. Consider using complementary hooks instead of conflicting ones.

#### Issue: "Performance degradation with multiple hooks"
**Solution:** Limit active hooks to 3-5 for optimal performance. Prioritize the most relevant hooks for your current workflow.

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Claude Desktop Specific Issues
1. **Configuration file not found**: Create the directory structure if it doesn't exist
2. **JSON parsing errors**: Validate your JSON syntax using an online validator
3. **Changes not taking effect**: Clear Claude's cache and restart completely

#### Web Interface Issues
