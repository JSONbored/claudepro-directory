<!-- Example: FAQ Component Output -->
<section itemScope itemType="https://schema org/FAQPage">
  <div itemScope itemType="https://schema org/Question">
    <h3 itemProp="name">How do these components work?</h3>
    <div itemScope itemType="https://schema org/Answer">
      <div itemProp="text">They use Schema org markup...</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

### AI Platform Optimization
Components are specifically optimized for:
- **ChatGPT**: Structured content parsing and citation
