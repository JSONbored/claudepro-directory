{/* INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE DESKTOP:
DiagnosticFlow creates an interactive decision tree for troubleshooting. Use for:
- Step-by-step diagnostic processes
- Binary decision paths (yes/no questions)
- Quick problem identification flows
- Guided troubleshooting workflows

Each step configuration:
- question: The diagnostic question to ask (keep concise and specific)
- yesPath: Next question if answer is yes (must match another step's question exactly)
- noPath: Next question if answer is no (must match another step's question exactly)
- solution: Final solution when diagnosis is complete (provide actionable fix)

Best practices:
- Start with most common issues first
- Keep questions binary (yes/no only)
- Provide clear, testable conditions
- Include solution at terminal nodes
- Limit to 5-10 steps for usability
- Use actual diagnostic patterns from support data
