# Full-Stack Development Workflow

*Complete workflow guide - September 2025*

Complete guide to using Claude agents for end-to-end application development.

## Workflow Overview

This workflow combines multiple Claude agents to build complete web applications from concept to deployment. Updated for the latest Claude capabilities as of September 2025.

## Required Agents


### 1. Backend Agent
**Recommended:** [API Builder Agent](/agents/api-builder-agent)

Role: API and server logic


### 2. Frontend Agent
**Recommended:** [Backend Architect](/agents/backend-architect)

Role: User interface


### 3. Database Agent
**Recommended:** [Database Specialist](/agents/database-specialist)

Role: Data modeling


### 4. Testing Agent
**Recommended:** [Frontend Specialist](/agents/frontend-specialist)

Role: Quality assurance


## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Phase 1: Planning & Architecture
1. Define requirements
2. Design database schema
3. Plan API endpoints
4. Create component hierarchy

### Phase 2: Implementation
1. Build backend services
2. Create frontend components
3. Integrate APIs
4. Add authentication

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
1. Write unit tests
2. Perform integration testing
3. Optimize performance
4. Deploy to production

## Example Prompts

### Starting the Workflow
```
Help me design a REST API for a todo application with user authentication
```

### Mid-Process Adjustments
```
Create React components for the todo list with proper state management
```

### Quality Checks
```
Review my code and suggest improvements for scalability
```

## Best Practices

- Start with clear API contracts
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling
- Write tests alongside code
- Document as you go

## Common Pitfalls

- **Avoid:** Starting without clear requirements
- **Avoid:** Ignoring security considerations
- **Avoid:** Skipping error handling
- **Avoid:** Not planning for scale

## Performance Metrics

Track these metrics to optimize your workflow:
- Time to completion
- Output quality score
- Number of iterations needed
- Error rate

## Advanced Tips

For power users looking to maximize efficiency:
1. Chain multiple agents for complex tasks
2. Create templates for recurring workflows  
3. Use variables for dynamic content
4. Implement feedback loops
