# Debugging and Problem Resolution Workflow

Systematic approach to debugging and resolving code issues

**Goal:** Efficiently identify, analyze, and resolve code problems

## Workflow Steps

### Problem Identification

- Use /debug command for initial problem analysis
- Apply /explain command to understand code behavior
- Gather relevant logs and error information
- Identify potential root causes

### Solution Development

- Develop targeted fixes for identified issues
- Use /refactor-code for structural improvements
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Create tests to prevent regression

### Validation and Documentation

- Test fixes thoroughly in multiple scenarios
- Document the issue and resolution process
- Update relevant documentation and guides
- Share learnings with the development team


## Required Commands

### [/debug](/commands/debug)
Advanced debugging assistant with root cause analysis, step-by-step troubleshooting, and automated fix suggestions

**Usage:** `/debug`

### [/explain](/commands/explain)
Intelligent code explanation with visual diagrams, step-by-step breakdowns, and interactive examples

**Usage:** `/explain`

### [/review](/commands/review)
Comprehensive code review with security analysis, performance optimization, and best practices validation

**Usage:** `/review`

### [/security](/commands/security)
Comprehensive security audit with vulnerability detection, threat analysis, and automated remediation recommendations

**Usage:** `/security`


## Implementation Guide

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure Claude Code is properly configured
2. **Install Commands**: Set up all required commands in your workspace
3. **Configure Integration**: Connect commands to work together seamlessly
4. **Test Each Phase**: Verify each phase works correctly before proceeding
5. **Automate Workflow**: Set up automation for repetitive tasks

## Best Practices

- **Command Chaining**: Link commands together for automated workflows
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track workflow execution and optimize
- **Documentation**: Keep workflow documentation up to date

## Troubleshooting

- **Command Conflicts**: Ensure commands work well together
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor resource usage and optimize
- **Integration Problems**: Check command configurations and dependencies
- **Error Recovery**: Implement fallback strategies for failures
