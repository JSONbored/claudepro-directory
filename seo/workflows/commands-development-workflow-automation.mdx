## Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "Workflows not activating properly"
**Solution:** Ensure the workflows is loaded at conversation start, not mid-conversation. For Claude Desktop, completely restart the application after adding configurations.

#### Issue: "Generic responses despite workflows configuration"
**Solution:** Verify the configuration content is properly formatted and complete. Check for any JSON syntax errors in Claude Desktop configurations.

#### Issue: "Inconsistent development automation expertise level"
**Solution:** Be more specific in your prompts and provide relevant context. The more detailed your request, the better the specialized response.

#### Issue: "Configuration conflicts with other workflows"
**Solution:** Review your configuration for overlapping or contradictory instructions. Consider using complementary workflows instead of conflicting ones.

#### Issue: "Performance degradation with multiple workflows"
**Solution:** Limit active workflows to 3-5 for optimal performance. Prioritize the most relevant workflows for your current workflow.

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Claude Desktop Specific Issues
1. **Configuration file not found**: Create the directory structure if it doesn't exist
2. **JSON parsing errors**: Validate your JSON syntax using an online validator
3. **Changes not taking effect**: Clear Claude's cache and restart completely

#### Web Interface Issues
1. **Workflows not persisting**: Reload the configuration at the start of each new conversation
2. **Long configuration causing errors**: Break down complex workflows into smaller, focused configurations
3. **Context window limitations**: Prioritize essential workflows elements for longer conversations
