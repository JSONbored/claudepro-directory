# Development Workflow Automation

Automate common development tasks using Claude commands

**Goal:** Streamline development workflow with automated task execution

## Workflow Steps

### Code Preparation

- Use /optimize command for performance improvements
- Apply /refactor-code for structure enhancement
- Run code quality checks and validations
- Ensure coding standards compliance

### Git Integration

- Use /git-smart-commit for intelligent commit messages
- Create meaningful branch and tag names
- Generate comprehensive commit descriptions
- Maintain clean git history and documentation

### Quality Assurance

- Run comprehensive test suites
- Perform security and vulnerability checks
- Validate performance and optimization
- Generate deployment-ready artifacts


## Required Commands

### [/git-smart-commit](/commands/git-smart-commit)
Intelligently analyzes changes and creates well-formatted git commits with conventional commit messages

**Usage:** `/git-smart-commit`

### [/optimize](/commands/optimize)
Advanced performance optimization with bottleneck analysis, memory profiling, and automated improvements

**Usage:** `/optimize`

### [/refactor](/commands/refactor)
Intelligent code refactoring command that analyzes code structure and applies best practices for improved maintainability and performance

**Usage:** `/refactor`


## Implementation Guide

1. **Setup Environment**: Ensure Claude Code is properly configured
2. **Install Commands**: Set up all required commands in your workspace
3. **Configure Integration**: Connect commands to work together seamlessly
4. **Test Each Phase**: Verify each phase works correctly before proceeding
5. **Automate Workflow**: Set up automation for repetitive tasks

## Best Practices

- **Command Chaining**: Link commands together for automated workflows
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track workflow execution and optimize
- **Documentation**: Keep workflow documentation up to date

## Troubleshooting

- **Command Conflicts**: Ensure commands work well together
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor resource usage and optimize
- **Integration Problems**: Check command configurations and dependencies
- **Error Recovery**: Implement fallback strategies for failures
