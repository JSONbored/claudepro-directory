## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:

- **Windows 10 version 1903** (Build 18362 1049) or later, preferably Windows 11
- **Administrator access** for enabling Windows features
- **8GB RAM minimum**, 16GB recommended for optimal performance
- **20GB free disk space** for WSL distribution and development files
- **Basic command-line familiarity** with terminal operations

<InfoBox type="warning" title="BIOS Virtualization Required">
**Critical**: Virtualization must be enabled in your BIOS/UEFI. Missing this step causes 40% of installation failures. Check Task Manager → Performance → CPU to verify "Virtualization: Enabled" status.

  ]}

## Understanding PATH Conflicts

The most insidious WSL issue involves PATH inheritance, where Windows executables silently override Linux commands. Here's why this matters and how to fix it:

<InfoBox type="error" title="The PATH Problem Explained">
By default, WSL inherits Windows PATH entries, causing:
- Windows npm executing instead of WSL npm (3-5x slower)
- Incompatible tool versions between environments
- Cryptic "command not found" errors despite packages being installed
- Node js modules compiled for wrong architecture
</InfoBox>

### Smart PATH Management Solution

Create this function in your `~/.bashrc` for intelligent PATH handling:

```bash
## Smart PATH function - Add to ~/.bashrc
win_path_filter() {
    # Check if in Windows filesystem
    if [[ "$PWD" == /mnt/* ]]; then
        # Include essential Windows tools
export PATH="$PATH:/mnt/c/Windows/System32:/mnt/c/Program Files/Microsoft VS Code/bin"
    else
        # Linux filesystem - use Linux tools only
        export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:$HOME/.npm-global/bin"
    fi
}

## Run on directory change
PROMPT_COMMAND="win_path_filter; $PROMPT_COMMAND"
```

## Performance Optimization Deep Dive

Achieving optimal performance requires understanding WSL2's architecture and its impact on file operations:

### Filesystem Performance Matrix

| Location | Read Speed | Write Speed | Use Case |
|----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| ~/projects/ (ext4) | 500 MB/s | 450 MB/s | All development work |
| /mnt/c/ (9P protocol) | 50 MB/s | 30 MB/s | Accessing Windows files only |
| /tmp/ (tmpfs) | 2000. MB/s | 1800 MB/s | Temporary build files |

<InfoBox type="success" title="Performance Best Practices">
**Always** develop in Linux filesystem (`~/projects/`)  
**Never** run npm install on /mnt/c/ paths  
**Configure** build tools to use /tmp for temporary files  
**Exclude** WSL paths from Windows Defender scanning  
**Limit** WSL memory to prevent system slowdown
</InfoBox>

### Windows Defender Exclusion Script

Run this PowerShell script as Administrator to exclude WSL from real-time scanning:

```powershell
## Add WSL to Windows Defender exclusions
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "\\wsl$\"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "\\wsl localhost\"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "$env:USERPROFILE\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited*"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "wsl exe"
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionProcess "wslservice exe"

Write-Host "WSL excluded from Windows Defender scanning" -ForegroundColor Green
```
