## Cloud Platform Integration Deep Dive

### AWS Service Support

**Amazon Q Developer** demonstrates unparalleled AWS expertise with native support for over 250 AWS services. The platform generates complete CloudFormation templates with proper cross-service dependencies and provides AWS-specific security scanning that identifies vulnerabilities in AWS API usage patterns. Real-world example: BT Group generated 200,000 lines of AWS code with 37% acceptance rate in just four months.

**Claude Code** via AWS Bedrock delivers exceptional AWS CDK generation capabilities, converting architecture diagrams directly into TypeScript or Python infrastructure code. Its 200,000-token context window enables analysis of entire AWS architectures. TELUS saved $90 million using Claude on AWS, generating 13,000+ internal AI tools.

**Gemini Code Assist** offers basic AWS support through generic cloud patterns but lacks specialized knowledge for advanced services like Step Functions, EventBridge, or complex IAM permission boundaries.

### Multi-Cloud Architecture Support

<InfoBox type="highlight" title="Multi-Cloud Winner">
Claude Code emerges as the clear multi-cloud champion, maintaining platform-agnostic design that enables sophisticated architectures spanning AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure without vendor lock-in.
</InfoBox>

Claude generates production-ready Terraform configurations across all major cloud providers while maintaining consistent quality. Real implementations show Claude designing complex systems combining:
- AWS S3 for storage
- Google BigQuery for analytics  
- Azure AI services for machine learning
- Cross-cloud networking and identity federation

### Hidden Cost Considerations

<InfoBox type="warning" title="Budget Reality Check">
Enterprise deployments reveal hidden costs beyond subscription fees, with implementation, training, and operational overhead adding 30-40% to published prices.
</InfoBox>

- **Amazon Q Developer**: Pooled transformation limits (4,000 lines monthly shared) can bottleneck large modernization projects
- **Claude**: Premium pricing justified by superior code quality and reduced review time
- **Gemini**: Code customization requires expensive Enterprise tier at $45/month
